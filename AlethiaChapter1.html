                    Traditionally, in a book such as this, the very first page of the very
                    first chapter is dedicated to a prayer recitation, or an introduction of
                    sorts that underlines the book’s legitimacy to the people that it is meant
                    to address. There’s a description of God’s qualities that a human should
                    imbibe, there’s a mention of the cosmic lineage of the mouthpiece
                    responsible for the story behind the book, or there’s a list of
                    incantations to be said before beginning anything to demonstrate the
                    orator’s respect for the Almighty.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    However, history is proof that this approach does not work. Even still,
                    look at the number on this page. It surely isn’t the first page. So then,
                    why am I rallying against something I myself have just done? Am I
                    hypocritical, or did I just want to waste a hundred pages just talking
                    about my special self?
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    The answer is neither. The previous books that were written, didn’t just
                    contain banal salutations, and pointless incantations – certainly not in
                    the very beginning. The authors of the book made God easily accessible by
                    providing you with the most important information in the very beginning.
                    Practicing religious friends of mine have even scoffed at me for even
                    thinking of reading a scripture, any scripture, in its entirety. What a
                    weird thing to discourage. Why wouldn’t you want to read the complete
                    theory of everything?
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    One answer, and one alone – it’s boring; and with good reason too – half
                    the stuff in the book is not meant for a regular person to comprehend. What
                    could a person in the 2nd century CE have done after reading a prophecy for
                    the 21st century? What use did a slave have for laws that governed the
                    master? What was the point of mentioning the bloodline of Abraham
                    repeatedly?
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                It didn’t matter then, if you started the book with <em>Om</em>,	<em>Ik Onkar</em>, <em>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim</em> or <em>Our Father</em>
                    – they have all been lead to the same demise –
                    <em>
                        mechanical performance of outdated rituals in times of
                        socio-politico-cultural decadence which is almost always coupled with
                        an impending economic downfall
                    </em>
                    .

                <p class="verse">
                Ordinarily, I wouldn’t even begin a conversation with the impending, but	<em>definitive apocalypse</em>, much less the only book I will ever write –
                    but if not <em>here</em> then where, and if not <em>now</em> then when? If
                    I don’t have the courage to talk about <em>the Rapture</em> in a book that
                    nobody has read, and will read for a considerable amount of time, how can I
                    be entirely honest in the only book I will ever write?

                    It is a very famous quotation that “all roads to Hell are paved with good
                    intentions.” I don’t doubt that – not in the slightest. I do, however,
                    wonder and worry tremendously, about the degradation and the degeneration
                    of individuals in particular, and societies at large, that occurs several
                    generations after <em>any revolution</em> has triumphed, and slowly died
                    down.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    What I have pondered over, and the conclusions that I then arrived at,
                    would be the subject of another book, and as such, not comprehensible to a
                    major subset of human population. Despite that, what I can, and am
                    permitted to, write about, is something much more substantial, that will
                help humans renew their covenant with God in a way that they	<em>understand best</em>, and are <em>most comfortable</em> with.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                What I am really proposing here, in indirect terms, is the	<em>formulation of a new religion</em> – because that, despite what you may
                    have been led to believe by your volition or force, is the need of this
                    time. To get to the point where I have wanted this movement to have gotten,
                    I see only two options with high chances of success.

                <p class="verse">
                    The first one being the easiest – tyranny. History is proof that you can
                    have the best intentions at heart, and <em>believe</em> that you have God’s
                    support, yet descend into tyranny when tested against the currents of the
                    time. On one hand, <em>forced conversions</em> are a very effective way to
                    bring all the people together – regardless of their customs, previous
                    beliefs and existing understanding of life – into a single entity so that
                    an outward appearance of unity can be seen; but that’s just it – it is just
                the <em>appearance of unity</em>, not an	<em>organically developed harmony</em>.

                I could slap the modern sticker of diversity on it, and to counter them,	<em> </em>you could propose a plethora of ways in which

                <p class="verse">
                To explain and understand the universe, we have to rely upon our	<em>own</em> perception of it – the organic capability of which,
                    incidentally, almost everyone has more or less at the same level. The funny
                    thing is, that we are <strong>bound</strong> in our understanding of
                    everything because of our <em>finite</em> perceptual experiences.

                <p class="verse">
                    Our understanding is limited by the quality and quantity of information
                    about the world that we are able to <em>perceive</em>. Thus, to understand
                the universe – or actually – our perception of it – we have to	<strong>understand the nature of information first</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    It is not just that we perceive in a unidirectional manner – wherein
                    information only goes in and triggers a response. It is a feedback loop of
                    “reflexive self-perception” – more commonly known as introspection,
                    specifically, internal perception of the self that <em>mirrors</em> our
                    understanding of the outside world. The thinking-being, who operates in
                    such a manner, continually develops an all encompassing theory of reality
                    as it were as <em>this being </em>passes through life – the theory commonly
                    referred to as the their “mindset.”

                    Given that this mindset is limited to the experiences, thus perceptions,
                and thus the information intake, and finally, the<em>understanding of a single being</em> – the	<strong>absolute validity</strong> of such a model is almost always very
                    limited.

                    Now this mindset might be, in most cases, limited – but on a very high

                    very universe that it is modelled upon. Think of it as a beginner’s
                    tutorial version of the multi-billion user app that everybody wishes they
                    had built. A person whose mindset appeals, even tangentially, to another

                    before and in my time, but I surely hope that it doesn’t stay that way. The

                    the foremost thing that we have been studying all this time (the printing

                    to do things without God. We get so engrossed in the workings of our puny

                    After my <em>42 Days of Freedom</em>, I wanted this power forever. I
                    thought I would never lose it. Once I had gained an understanding of the
                    intricate workings of the universe – both inner and outer – I thought I
                    could just summon the “magic” anywhere, at anytime. I was disastrously
                    wrong. As God would have it, over the next 15 years, I would have to learn
                    to acquire this power on my own merit without any supplements.

                <p class="verse">
                    Of course, the way God had planned for things to happen, I did end up going
                    back to the shitty life that I had <em>pre-Satori</em>. The only difference
                    was that now I was better prepared for what would be thrown at Me – better
                    yet, I had God by my side. If I played my cards right, applied the right
                    knowledge in the right place and at the right time, and practiced all that

                    </em>
                    . The second was a lesson for myself to remember and engrain in my mind –
                    <em>
                        if I was nothing without this power, then I did not deserve to have it

                <p class="verse">
                    It is a lesson in humility, but also a test of self-determination. If I was
                    only doing this in order to gain absolute power over people, then I was

                    to the place I informally referred to as Heaven. I thought, that my oath
                    towards God meant that I had to somehow <em>be the guide</em> for all
                    people, of all nations – all the people of this time, my current time, as a

                    during childhood years – but only acquired by careful assessment and
                    discernment as an adult. Of course I could be modest here, unassuming even,
                    and say that just because I was allowed a chance to learn from Him

                    just one sect of people, trying to convince them of my legitimate
                    connection to God. I did not want to fight this internal dissonance about

                    internal urge to fight with a yet imaginary, but surely plausible opponent
                    – who will, in all respects, be the <em>disbeliever that I was </em>during

                    apply the same logic and senses that you are trying to understand (see:
                Serpent Halo). <em>You cannot do so otherwise</em>. The explanation of the	<em>Alethian Model of the Universe</em>, therefore, can only be understood

                    The phrase, self-configuring self-processing language (SCSPL) comes into

                    application, some events occur in the surroundings that are then perceived
                    by us – causing us to change and alter our method of interaction so that

                    Recent developments in the <strong>science of reality theories</strong>
                    have been reaching an inflection point wherein, to move forward and make
                any substantial progress, they have to first	<em>detach themselves from talking only about material objects</em>.

                    The aim of scientists is to discover and to explain regularities in the
                    patterns of natural phenomena. Even so, there is a difference between the
                    irregularities of the real objects and the regular unchanging blueprints
                    that govern them. In particular, the genesis of <em>form</em> in nature is
                    an important issue which gives rise to many controversial explanations.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    It is important, then, to consider not only the isolated objects, but also
                    the <strong>network of relations</strong> existing among them. One of the
                    pioneers of <em>Alethia</em>, Aristotle, in De Anima, set out to enquire
                    into the nature of the soul – but before that, he said, that to enquire
                    into the nature of any phenomenon, you have to first decide if whether it
                is the <em>act</em> you want to study or the	<em>thing that facilitates</em> said act.

                <p class="verse">
                    The most prominent theories dealing in the nature of reality are the theory
                    of Chaos (formally: Complexity Theory), the theory of self-organising
                    systems, and the Intelligent Design Theory. It has been widely speculated
                    and observed, that chaotic behaviour is the result of non-linear
                    interactions between different elements of a complex system.

                <p class="verse">
                    To that end, I could just end Alethia here stating that
                    <em>
                        the universe operates on the Intelligent Design of Chaos, which is only
                        perceptible to the human eye/mind via the illusion of order which can
                        be seen as the system rapidly self-organises.

                    Since any statement can be open to misinterpretation after millennia, I
                    will delve much deeper into this one, because weird things happen when
                    important things are left unsaid, especially so in the field of religion.

                <p class="verse">
                    It also needs to be stated here, in the very beginning, that the basis of
                    reality is not matter, as was the traditional view. It is not even purely
                    information as is the current, modern, view. It turns our that there are a
                    lot of physical and perceptual layers to reality.

                <p class="verse">
                    These layers are multifaceted, in that they get expressed in different ways
                in different scenarios and under different states of mind, but	<strong>at the very basic level</strong>, programmatically speaking, the
                    physical reality is is a two part composition – the first one comprising
                    the <em>Strings of Time</em> through which energy travels.

                    The Strings of Time form the structural scaffolding, and govern the
                    movements of all that is that you can and cannot see. These strings start
                    from infinity, go through each of the base indivisible expressions (BIE) of
                    matter which <em>loop around in a rendition of the trefoil knot</em>, and
                    go back to infinity again.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    This holds true for every BIE of matter that has, or will ever exist. As
                these strings twist and turn and bend – they give the	<strong>illusion of space</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    When these strings do form knots, as is the nature of bending, looping, and
                    intersecting strings, they trap energy within a definite expressed area –
                    and as Einstein has proved mathematically in the previous century:

                    So, it turns out, that humanity’s traditional understanding of their
                    surroundings was almost right – matter and energy do form the structural
                    basis for the physical reality – although, not in the way that we have
                    classically understood.

                    not more, expansive world exists in our minds. If the classical view of
                matter/energy is right, it would hardly seem fair if we<em>disregarded entirely</em> the modern viewpoint of	<strong>information</strong> being the base of all that we experience.

                <p class="verse">
                    Let’s go back to the Aristotelian notion of wanting to study the act, or
                    the thing that facilitates said act. I have already told you that the
                    structure of reality is held by the Strings of Time. These strings are not
                    to be confused with the poorly conceived, yet emerging String Theory which

                    and untangle in a <em>dance</em> of self-reorganisation as we traverse

                    The object of any new writing, any innovative analysis, and any novel
                    approach is always to preserve that which is valuable in the old methods
                    while adjoining new methods that refine their meaning and extend their
                    horizons, likewise, I would like to thank Christopher Michael Langan,
                    without whose paper, the ‘Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe,’ to
                    serve as scaffolding, my efforts to actually write something empirically
                    replicable and verifiable would’ve been met with disappointment and
                    self-loathing.

                    When I started writing this, I meant for my writing to be an addendum to
                all previous works of metaphysical reality theories and laws – but the	<em>technical debt</em> arising from the simplicity of those works, and
                    thus, their propensity for misinterpretation has already crippled much of
                    what we love and adore about this life giving rock of ours and is well on
                    the way to disrupt the other cosmic elements it shares synchronous
                    choreography with.

                    With that in mind, it is imperative that this work is elevated to the
                    highest status, with all of the previous works being regarded as subclasses
                    of the <em>Alethian model</em>, whose foundation I have laid in this
                    chapter, and whose relevance I will proceed to sketch out in the following
                    pages.

                    This also means that most (not all) theories and principles and theologies
                    of <strong>understanding reality </strong>are <em>somewhat valid</em> – but
                    they cannot be allowed any further to exist as self-contained sandboxes as
                    they always have affected the world in the most intricate and profound
                    ways.

                    They are an integral part of the people’s reality – and by extension –
                    their perceptions/actions regarding it. They haven’t gone down the gutter
                    altogether. We will scrap them for parts.

                    Science as we now know, will thereby be changed, but it is a tiny
                    sacrifice, as in return – fate will smile upon us – and give us vast gains
                in depth, significance and explanatory power, and hopefully,	<strong>constructive empathy</strong>.
