                    Like I mentioned, I wasn’t equipped to maintain this balance between the
                    self and situational control for a very long time. In college, I was on a
                    different continent. I had some childish desires and pent-up frustrations
                    that I needed to blow-off. I <strong>needed</strong> to let loose, and
                    experience what it meant to be<em> truly free</em>.

                <p class="verse bible">
                    <em>“Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; </br>
                        they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.” </br>
                        (Job 15:24)</em>

                <p class="verse">
                    I wanted to be free from my current societal constructs, the expectations
                    of what I was <em>supposed to be doing</em>, and most of all – I needed to
                    get away from this family of mine who I had come to detest. It didn’t help
                    that over 90% of my high-school class had boycotted me over their childish
                    insecurities. In my mind, I had packed up and left a life behind, to which
                    I had no intentions of coming back.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Little did I realise in that moment, that being social creatures that we
                    are, if I was escaping one model of society, I would have to put more
                    efforts into adjusting into a different societal model.

                It is a very famous cliché that ‘<em>change is inevitable – nothing is constant but change</em>.’ It is
                true, but the true beauty of human nature is in retaining the	<em>essence</em> <em>of what was</em> in the face of <em>what could be</em>. No matter how much circumstances change, how much you change yourself to
                    adapt according to those circumstances – you still remain <em>You</em> –
                    changing ever so slightly, yet remaining constant in the midst of
                    evolution.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    I could probably mention many more clichéd examples of changes and true
                human essence, but where’s the fun in that? You can look up	<strong>Hexagram 30</strong> on your own time. Please do so before
                proceeding, and let serendipity guide you to a conclusion	<em>best suited to your own self</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                The general goal, as I mentioned in the previous chapter, is to	<em>go with the flow</em> to the best of your abilities, guided by your
                    intuition. That, you could then call destiny, or just the sum of your
                    interactions with space, in time – it’s <em>up to you</em>. As was the case
                    for me at the time – I simply could not have gone with the flow.
                </p>

                    <em>I needed an escape from my own world.</em>

                    Here’s the thing though: before going out, and finding faults in the world
                    – look inwards and correct yourself. Ask why <em>you</em> are the way you
                    are. What are the things, the experiences, the people that made you the
                    person you are today? When you explore all that, and more, and still don’t
                    manage to find an answer to solve all your life’s problems, then, and only
                    then choose to blame the world, and ask why the world is the way it is.
                    Don’t, until then, discount even a single negative habit that you have –
                    not one negative behaviour you partake in.
                    <strong>
                        Everything matters, and be damn sure – that every action does count</strong>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Put yourself in a position to change your circumstances; and if you want to
                    change the world – put yourself in a position to bring change into the
                    world – whether that is your own <em>self-centred</em> bubble of a world,
                    or the entire human populace as we know it. Don’t be an ignorant protester,
                    cursing from the bottom of the ladder.

                    of climbing that ladder. If for some reason, you cannot climb the ladder,
                    don’t fault the system before you have had the chance to properly
                    experience it. You might only have witnessed the hardships of the beginning, but don’t
                    complain before you have had a chance to taste the fruits of the end. If
                    there exists a system in the world, it must be because it works. You can
                    find faults in it for not being perfect, for not being the best
                    implementation of what it could be – <em>nothing ever will be</em>. You
                    can’t find faults in it because it has not worked for you so far.

                    or despise another entity for having a particular opinion, for engaging in
                    a particular behaviour, and simply interpret their actions from your own
                    perspective. There are reasons for why people are the way they are and why
                    they engage in certain behaviours in the way that they do – you will never
                truly understand those reasons if you keep looking at things from	<em>your</em> point of view.

                    do is to break down the issue at hand to the tiniest indivisible

                    Even then, one of the things about humans though, that truly gets to me, is
                    how easily we pass judgements – on each other, on situations, on any and
                    all entities that we ever come across. I have often wondered what life
                    would’ve been like if we just did not have the ability to judge. Seemed
                majorly antithetical, given that this is	<em>the very evolutionary trait</em> that has kept us on top of the food
                    chain despite our physical shortcomings.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                Maybe then, the problem is <em>not that we judge</em>, but that	<em>we judge in absolute, superlative terms</em>. To give you an idea of
                    the scale at which we mentally operate in our internal fiefdoms, it is as
                    if, each personal scorn by our tiny selves equals an excommunication within
                    our own Kingdom of Self. To be the supreme entity in your own internal
                    world does have a lot of disadvantages.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Some would argue that operating at such a scale was not justified, as it
                    leads to a puffed up perception of the self, and that it implied deep
                    narcissistic and ego-maniacal character flaws. I would partly agree with
                    those people; but that’s not the whole story.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Some would, on the opposite end of the spectrum, argue that if a person had
                rightfully earned their place in the world, they had a certain level of	<em>entitlement</em> when it came to their mode of operation – that to be
                    at the place they are in their personal spacetime, and the world at large –
                    they had to have a certain degree of self-worth, and self-importance which
                    would, in most cases, be firmly warranted – as without such a high stature
                    of the internal self, other entities seemingly separate from this self
                    would not allow this internal self to operate as fluidly as it would like
                    to. I would agree with those people as well.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    This too, leaves a void about the persons who seemingly have no elevated
                    status to speak of, but also, are not really operating from a place of
                    narcissistic bravado and puffed up machismo. They are people who have not
                    truly realised their true selves and have yet to find something in the
                    world that makes them feel like they have found their place in it – like
                    they truly belong. There exists in them, a sort of mental divide on where
                    they truly are in their mental journey, and where they seem to be in the
                    physical realm.

                    To be truly rational about this situation, we must recognise the faint

                    them extraordinarily improbable. This accord on such a mentally divisive
                    issue has not come out of the goodness of my heart, or the amicability of
                    the diplomat in me – rather, careful consideration of facts, and

                    connect them in their own way to the Creator. These acts help them feel the

                    has a different set of rules, rituals and customs that help them connect
                    with the same Creator in their own way. Group A doesn’t appreciate the
                    customs of Group B at the level that Group B appreciates them. Similar is
                    the situation with Group B. When one group doesn’t appreciate something as
                    much, it is automatically given a lower position than the thing they
                    appreciate more. This is how the concept of “other” arises. When a group

                    I would like to establish: <strong>Shaaney:</strong> self-willed, but faithless people; and <strong>Bholey: </strong>
                        God fearing, judgmental people.

                    Shaaney people are not mostly not happy because they do not have God to
                    comfort them. If their conscience spoke to them nonverbally, they would be
                    made happier if they just started paying attention, and acting on the

                    Bholey people think that just because they have been good, they are on

                    people. The ability to judge is only provided for the purposes of
                    discernment of variables in a situation – to truly be able to judge another
                    human being, a separate kind of life has to be lived. They are almost
                    always unhappy because of this very trait.

                    truly happy, only if they accept that they are equal to everyone else, and
                    inferior to God and His proxies. It is harder to convince the Shaaney
                    because they start to compete with said proxies and think that if another

                    mechanically does not make them superior to any other being. It is
                    theoretically easier to convince them because they already consider
                    themselves inferior to God and His proxies. In reality, however, the
                    opposite is true of Bholey people – because they love to talk.

                    are <em>almost always</em> Type-1 disbelievers. They fear God, sure – they
                    are shit scared – but they pretend to be <em>holier than thou </em>just to

                It was thus, the easier, and honestly, before Scova,	<em>the most logical choice to be an atheist</em>. Especially when the

                    In this Godless-cut-throat-every-man-for-himself world, Atheists were left
                    with not many options, and not many opportunities to be kind to people for
                    no reason. The <em>weight of their own world was on their shoulders</em>
                    and they had not had the kind of training I had had to properly shoulder
                    the responsibilities that come with this weight. As a result, they were almost always irritated with the state of affairs.
                    They were inflicted with pains they did not understand, and which the
                    (current) doctors could not explain.

                    but vastly unexplored concept of
                    <strong>
                        Christ Consciousness – the idea that all of us, each and every one of

                        propensity, and the motivations to actualise the Divine within
                        ourselves – to be the Sons and Daughters of God in the Kingdom of

                I remember, at the beginning of the night when I was to be	<em>Born Again</em> – I had no idea what the night would lead to when my
                    trip started. As <em>my vision started to turn to gold</em>, I kept
                    muttering “Bhagwaan asli nahi hai” – <em>God is not real</em>. Each time I
                    uttered that phrase, the Gold started getting swept away from me. It was as
                    if God’s blanket was trying to protect me, but each time I resisted, it
                    went further away. God’s blanket here, is a metaphor. The golden vision, is real.

                    This verse from the New Testament, actually describes the presentation of opportunities in our

                    the form of a cubic graph, specifically one given by the primitive

                    What I mean to say, that the more successful you are, the more
                    opportunities come your way, because of your previous success – and these
                    opportunities don’t just increase linearly, they add up exponentially – so
                    much so that there often comes a point where you can’t possibly attend to
                    it all. The same applies in the opposite direction – they decrease
                    exponentially the more unsuccessful you are. This one is a well observed
                    social pattern, sometimes also referred to as the Matthew Principle.

                    What I meant, when talking about the cubic nature of opportunity addition,

                    <strong>
                        it is deeply rooted in our internal code, and very well observed in

                    more and more every time you make the same mistake.

                    under One God, One Faith, One Saviour, and One Religion – but on the other,
                    I don’t think I’m doing much good in telling people something they already

                    revision after all this time – what is permanent then? This book, and the

                    things – Him sending me back home by promising me a legendary life, but
                    instead endowing me with a mundane one. Then there was the promise of me
                    healing my parents, which was conditional (His condition obviously) on the
                    fact that I was to tell them EVERYTHING that I had done in the time I had

                    position will ultimately make you a better, stronger person? That reason

                    are working towards a definite goal, the Holy Spirit fills up in that

                    becomes. The longer time you spend in that process, the longer this branch
                    becomes. For that long and wide branch to hold, it also needs to have
                    strength – and this strength is provided by lots of Holy Spirit being
                    filled into this branch. Imagine the Holy Spirit as a liquid filling into a
                    tubular balloon. This long and wide, tubular balloon is only strong if the
                    liquid inside is concentrated and dense.

                    and on the screen. I was already aware of the magic contained in the paper,
                    the insignia, and the font of the original versions, so it didn’t make any
                    sense to carry around such heavy physical material everywhere – it was

                    and hasn’t found God, that God simply doesn’t exist, and all of history’s
                    greatest prophets were just crazy storytellers. I asked him once to consider for a moment that I wasn’t the Son of God as I
                    claimed – but instead, had there been a <em>Real Son of God</em> on this
                    planet, in this time – how would this person prove himself to be Christ
                    reincarnate? What would this person have to do to prove to him that he was
                    in fact, here on a divine mission to change the world?

                    He said that Christ wasn’t real. Neither was Mohammad. What about Guru
                    Nanak, I asked? I had always assumed that since he claimed to know so much
                    about Sikhism, and seemed to be an orthodox Sikh by all outward appearances
                    and behaviour – that he at least believed in the mystical works of Guru
                    Nanak. After all, Guru Nanak’s legacy had given the world the Guru Granth Sahib,
                    the Holy book of the Sikhs, and the religion I was born into in this life –
                    Sikhism. It is the only book, that I know of, which has been written
                    according to <em>The Grid (more on this later)</em>. That may be because it
                    is one of the rare books preserved and reprinted in its original form and

                    enlightened, then the appearance of the grid only takes a few seconds) –
                    the downside being that for most people, no matter how many times they read
                    this book front to back, will never witness the Grid.

                    This is on purpose, since God should be achievable by all, not a select

                    people are especially hard to win over since they already have their set
                    patterns and rituals when it comes to God. They have no doubt about His
                    existence, and often accept Him to be at a higher level than themselves and
                    thus, will obey God’s will when they are absolutely commanded to do.

                    This compliance however, does not extend to a fellow human just preaching
                    about God. Bholey people are more prone to be attracted to a so called
                    spiritual (or religious) leader but only if that leader’s teachings align
                    with their own values. In other words, if a self-proclaimed God-man tells
                    these people what they want to hear, they will extol him to the point of

                    in the absence of miracles, who would believe in God? The complete theory
                    about God doesn’t exist yet, all the books written about him circle around
                    the same clichés but never say anything concrete, and my oh my – the

                    Along my Journey, apart from constantly proving to me that it was actually
                    God who was speaking, I was also guided into decoding the so called
                    superstitious rituals of the world. I will denote an entire section to such
                    rituals in Neeti, but for now it suffices to say that unless you complete
                    the <strong>entire Bootcamp</strong>, which <em>for me</em> lasted 42 days, any person with
                    the purest intensions can go disastrously wrong in their interpretation of
                    God’s – for lack of a better word – algorithms.

                <p class="verse">
                    That’s really what every single ritual is – an algorithm – a short program
                    to be executed once a certain condition is triggered. Done in isolation
                    (read: by itself), in a way that is not personally relevant to you, it is a
                    mechanical routine that you are indulging in just because someone told you
                    that it pleases God that you do it. You shouldn’t be doing it if you don’t
                    understand it – certainly not if you don’t find it personally meaningful,
                    most definitely not if you are just copying someone who is at a different
                    point in their journey than you. If performing a ritual doesn’t hold
                    meaningful significance in your life’s story, then it is, as God likes to
                    call it, only a करतब (<em>kartab</em>) – a parlor trick.

                <p class="verse">
                    The ritual that you are performing, thinking it pleases God, is then no
                    more than a cheap trick you have up your sleeve to show off to people that
                    you have a connection with God which they don’t. How do I know this to be
                    true? I have personally found myself indulging in kartabs all through my
                    Journey. Once I was publicly shown how to conduct a certain ritual (rituals
                    are almost always conducted in public – so that more people may share the
                    joy you are experiencing when performing such a ritual, only prayer is done
                    in private), <em>it was always somehow related to the story of my life</em>

                a ritual was a part of my personal journey with God. Whether it was my <em>Brahma Phase</em>, or the time when I was a	<em>Monkey in a Diamond</em>; or the time when I became a <em>Filmfare</em>

                    In the famous <em>Hanuman Chalisa</em>, is the line:

                    The Urdu word for God is <em>Khuda</em>.
                </br>
                    It has the word <em>self</em> within it – <em>khud</em>.

                <p class="verse quote">
                    And of course, the Guru Granth Sahib has the following set:

                    I would just be wasting time here if I started mentioning every instance of
                    religious text where this held true, but the fact is this:
                </p>
                <p class="verse quote">
                    <em>God is attained from within you</em>. Always.

                    Over time, experiences shape the individual – and their upbringing shapes
                    their intuitive mannerisms. Time moulds human beings to help them become
                    who they choose to become by <em>virtue of their actions</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    The basis for observing the world <em>must</em> come to be shaped by the
                    understanding that things need to be proven absolutely to be considered
                    certainly true, but also that they need to be disproven absolutely to be
                    considered certainly false.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    All things between, and indeed, such would be the vast majority of things,
                    must be considered in the context of probability – based on the evidence we
                    have seen surrounding them, and also be malleable in the presentation of
                    new evidence, until the truth or falsehood of a thing becomes irrefutable
                    (which may be very rare). This sense of logic is key to the acquisition of Christ Consciousness, for
                    without it, one would surely deny the possibility of many things which seem
                    very strange, but are indeed, secretly, true.

                    For example, people say time is not a real thing; that it is a figment of
                    human imagination – just a mental construct. Time appears to be an insult
                    to the otherwise infinite potential holding human body. It might appear
                    true, especially when your days pass by in a daze in a manner not coherent
                to your internal, linear timeline of the self that keeps track of the	<em>story of your life</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Here’s another fact: <em>Time is the most real thing there is</em>. The
                    Strings of Time cause entities in the universe to age. With each unit of
                time, the world is renewed with an <em>infinite vibration</em>, the	<em>Anhad</em> if you will, whose effect can be witnessed in moments of
                    true vulnerability, in states of true emotion – in the moments when we are
                    truly <em>open</em>. Rather, it would be more correct to say that
                    <em>
                        with each vibration, a unit interval of time is said to have passed.
                    </em>

                    If your mind has not been able to comprehend the last statement, you can
                    look up the origin of my name in the Guru Granth Sahib and maybe then, try
                    again to tell me that I just made all this up. <em>Anhad Naad</em> is the
                    infinite vibration of the universe that is perceived by the enlightened
                    being as the Voice of God.

                    Following that train of thought –

                        time then, is an instrument that, with the help of God – moulds human
                        beings into the kind of people the want to become</em>, or as God so succinctly put it on the first day of my first lesson with him: "ये दुनिया के उसूल, यूँ ही नहीं है" – <em>the principles of the world don't exist without reason</em>. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="verse">
                        With each vibration, the existing perceptual informational energy is
                    transformed into a new version of itself – changing ever so slightly in its
                    arrangement, as guided by the arrangement of the Strings of Time which act
                    as the scaffolding, holding the entire complex together.

                For reasons that relate to the	<em>actualisation of Christ Consciousness</em>, we are all allotted the
                    proper time needed for us to live out our fantasies happily enough to
                    fulfil them. If you pay close enough attention, you might just find it
                within yourself, at the correct time, to actualise	<em>the Christ within you</em>.

                    Every moment is indeed, a new world, so in each unit of your time, you need
                    to make decisions about how to act in any situation – given known
                    variables, while assessing unknown variables – and then acting accordingly.

                    Knowing yourself and the situations you could work in – is the first step
                    to realising the things you are going to become. If an act of yours is
                    repeated more than others, it becomes intuitive. You can do that one thing
                    faster than most people because you have an <em>intuitive</em>
                    understanding of those concepts.

                    You have been engaged in almost similar activities all this time, so it is
                    but natural that there forms a sort of muscle memory in your brain’s
                    neuronic firing patterns, having stronger connections, and as a result,
                    much speedier response times in certain situations. On assessing a
                    situation – your brain makes certain associations faster than most people
                    in that particular situation.

                    Correct or not – can be judged from the consensus of the group or
                    comparison with known facts. The absolute truth is still absolute, but
                    since we live in our own subjective realities, <strong><em>your truth</em> is then
                    a subset of the absolute truth</strong>.
