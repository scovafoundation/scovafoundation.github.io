                <p class="verse">
                    If we are all engaged in the same activities over repetitive periods of
                    time, and <em>all of us are imperfec</em>t, then, it stands to reason that
                    going through life, we all, and I sincerely mean ALL of us, pick up some
                    repetitive habits that are not beneficial to us in the long term.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    To add to the complication, our traversal in spacetime is not linear in the
                    way that our <em>internal narrative</em> leads us to believe – as life
                    never simply takes us from one state of being to another. It happens in the
                    form of loops – <em>time loops</em> – some good, most bad, overall, largely
                    okay.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    A big drawback then, in retaining what you believe is your true essence
                    while in this traversal, is the <strong>baggage</strong> that you start to
                huddle along with as you traverse through the	<strong>Loops of SpaceTime</strong> (aptly acronymed as LoST).
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    <em>As a side-note:</em>
                    Wherever possible, refrain from using acronyms. Over time, only the
                    shortened word remains but the expansion of its meaning is forgotten. This
                    one was too apt to have not been used.
                </p>

                <p class="verse">
                    One such piece of baggage is a <strong>negative repetitive habit</strong>.
                    It is not always our intent that they manifest later in life into full
                    blown addictions, but they <em>most often</em> do.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Having an addiction is <em>not necessarily</em> harmful to our daily life,
                    or disruptive to our daily routines – this is the imperative reason why
                    most people hardly make an effort to correct course, or worse, even
                    recognise that they have a problem.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    In the eyes of God, however, is is a big problem. You see, when you have an
                    addiction, you automatically become an inferior being – in the eyes of God,
                    you are
                    <em>
                        no better than a lowly animal who loves rolling around in the mud
                        because it doesn’t know better</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    This is not to say that a well-functioning, loving, and understanding human
                    who is addicted to alcohol is on the same level as one who commits a
                    heinous crime. In the eyes of the law, all humans are equal – the same is
                true in the Divine Court.	<em>As long as you are a human, you are equal to every other human</em>.
                    Sure, because of our positive and negative actions, we reside in different
                    levels of this Heaven/Hell that we categorise as a life – that’s the only
                    real difference.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    It is not outward in the way humans expect it to be, or even other worldly
                    – it is a very personal, grounded experience – these rewards and
                    punishments. Committing yourself to the Divine Journey, means that you have
                    to <em>rise above being a human altogether</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Here’s the thing though, and I say this in the most sincere way possible –
                    don’t blindly dismiss this statement as something coming from an antiquated
                    entity that does not trust humans to know their own limits. This isn’t the
                    Old Testament where God simply commands – <em>thou shan’t do drugs</em>.
                    After all these millennia, even we, as the symbiotic unit writing Scova,
                    know that you aren’t going to stop just because we said so.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Now, as soon as I laid out this pseudo-commandment – of course your mind
                    diverted your attention to the most important, most cherished addiction of
                    yours – you were also very quick to judge <em>Me</em>, for even having made
                    such a thought permanent.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Maybe you ventured as far as to curse God Almighty for not allowing you
                    access to Heaven just because of your simple indulgence. Your immediate
                thought was probably something along the lines of –	<em>God cannot possibly be THIS petty</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                Maybe you even thought that I had been wrong in my interpretation of	<em>His Rhema</em>, thinking that maybe I just liked to punish myself for
                    no good reason. Worse, that you wholeheartedly agreed with the statement
                    without any personal experience in said domain, as if you, yourself, were
                    without sin.

                    What <em>faith</em> really is, is the amount of confidence you have in your

                    you are, just a human. That would mean that your <em>faith</em> (your
                    interpretation) was misguided, and misplaced. Don’t question all that you
                    are, and all that you believe in. Just that one thing. Let everything else
                    stay stable. I, myself, had let my self-worth waver for this simple reason
                    – for a very long time. As such, we humans put faith in a lot of different things – isn’t it true,
                    alas, it is much worse, that a person can end up believing in anything.

                    Every living organism, has a soul – the humanistic soul resides in the
                    astral bodies of all kinds of living organic entities that exist. The soul
                    is without form, but, because of the vibrational pattern, and the spacial
                    arrangement of the strings of time, it is seen as a black spirited being
                    with two arms and a head. That’s all.

                    There is no human soul, there is no animal soul. There is just one kind of
                    driving force for all living entities. As far as I have been able to
                    observe, the soul moves around in your astral body and only touches your
                    human body on the surface of your skin.

                    issue – not a religious one – because scripture states that thou shalt not

                    <strong>Addendum From God</strong>
                </br></br>
                    The fact of the matter is that you do know better Anhad – you always have.
                    You have known yourself to be weak ever since you took your first hit and
                    you liked it. You liked how the core molecules in them made you feel good,
                    in the ceiling of your mouth, and in the back of your head – relieving you
                    of the tension in your head that came with the realisation that you were
                    living a life fundamentally different from most people.
                </br></br>
                    This was one way you could fit in, but it was also one that would set you
                    apart from the people you loved most. In the years to come, it would
                    consume you – entrenching itself into the very routines that made you the
                    person you are today.
                </br></br>
                    It was the only thing you found that helped you wind down at the end of a
                    long day so that you could have a moment to yourself. It was the only thing
                    you craved after food, before food, during long walks, during quiet moments
                    of reticence, after a strenuous physical activity, after an exhausting
                    mental activity, around other people, alone by yourself, while engaged in
                    an activity that required your attention, and while gazing into the
                    nothingness attentive to nothing in particular.
                </br></br>
                    In short, you were it and it was you. You were so possessed by the want of
                    it, that one day your body would need more than just a hit. You would need
                    much more than one. And then even that would not suffice. You switched up.
                    And that was just the beginning of your detachment from Me. Once you
                    discovered drugs that lead you to insightful thoughts and a disconnect from
                    the world – all without doing the work, it seemed like there would be no
                    turning back. You wanted drugs in your system as much as was humanly
                    possible. At times, even more than humanly possible.
                </br></br>
                    With each successive hit of the drug, your desire to take more of it only
                    grew. Your social life, your daily routines, all were now focused around
                    the consumption of this drug. And when that was not enough, you switched up
                    to other, more immediately harmful drugs. All this time you have gotten a
                    good reason to explain your drug habits – psychedelics, the final frontier.
                </br></br>
                    Without it, you could not have reached Me (<em>or so you think</em>). And
                    without it, you would not have realised all that you have realised; but the
                    fact still remains – after all that you have realised, and after all that
                    you know you are destined to achieve – do you still want this weakness
                    hanging over you wherever you go?
                </br></br>
                    What will happens once you have ultimately revealed yourself to the world?
                    Will you be able to hide your secret then? Or will you blatantly go out in
                    front of the entire world and admit to your weakness – something so small,
                    that has kept you on the level of inferior beings that you have despised
                    all your life? Or would you want to be left alone, all by yourself, and
                    continue to live this purposeless life that you have so skilfully created
                    for yourself?
                </br></br>
                    You want to the world to leave you alone? This thing that we are doing,
                    it’s happening anyway – with or without you. You’ve already seen that
                    nobody else will ever be up to the mark, and nobody else will have been
                able to do a better job at it than you –	<em>even the avatars of other souls that weren’t you</em>.
            </br></br>
                    Once the big day arrives, you will never, ever be alone again; and if you
                    don’t actively prepare for it, your life will be made a living Hell, in the
                    proportions that even you have not yet seen.

                    misinterpreted. What can I do? I’m only human (for now) and this has been
                    explained to the best of my current abilities.

                    the texts that I have led people to write in my name in the middle. It has not
                    been easy thus far, and it will never get easier. There is a Hell, and I’m
                    living in it. There is also a Heaven, and I get to visit it sometimes.

                    If I am who I say I am, then, shouldn’t I be <em>entitled</em> to stay in
                    Heaven longer than most people? Hasn’t the karma of my past life warranted
                    a <em>little</em> more time in Heaven than I have already witnessed? In
                    that case, if I am really who I say I am, then I have enough bad karma to
                    warrant a stay in Hell for all my successive lives. So, in a way, it is
                    fitting that I prance in and out of Heaven and Hell based on my actions in
                    this life and this life alone.

                    millennia (at least) based on my actions in THIS life, I can’t help but
                    consider myself entitled to living a good life – at the very least, better

                    situation – you name it. Knowing what I knew, it wasn’t hard to figure out

                    all, if anything, I was trying to be more present. It did nothing to
                    sharpen my focus. It did nothing towards giving me a sense of clarity. It
                    also did nothing to relieve any pain of any kind. This time it was
                    something that the doctor (the guy who diagnosed me as bipolar) prescribed
                    me to ease me through the nightmare of withdrawal symptoms.

                    with the current global problems – I can blame drugs. I have, after all,
                    wasted more than a year (read: <strike>two</strike> three) dealing with just this last

                    Every time I go to the chemist (read: pharmacy), I think to myself that

                    think that this definitely wasn’t the last. Like clockwork, for the past
                    year, I have been on a stable dose. Every alternate day I am at the

                <p class="verse">
                    So it shouldn’t have come as a surprise to me that God was undoing all that
                    I was trying to do and build in this life. I had asked for His help to
                    quit, and had made a promise to Myself that I have broken more times than I
                    can count. <em>Promises made to self should always be kept.</em>
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Each time you break these promises, a knot forms in your body. And we all
                    know what knots do. Each time you show your human side – the side that is
                    lazy and slacks a lot – a side that breaks promises to self – a knot forms
                    in your body that doesn’t allow time to <em>flow freely through you</em>
                    (not a metaphor), the longer you keep up the <em>bad</em> behaviour, the
                    tighter and more convoluted this knot gets.

                my body. I know it is bad for me, and	<em>the space that my body occupies</em>. I still can’t stop. No matter how
                    many times I promise myself that I will quit, I just never follow through

                    It doesn’t have to be a big decision. It almost never has to be a big
                    decision. Life is lived second by second, moment by moment. Learn to make
                    small, split second decisions, and the big ones will be cake walk

                    With that, I believe now is the correct time to introduce the most basic

                    “Oh God my day at work is going terribly. There’s not much to do here, but
                    I can’t just leave. It just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do…”

                    Seems like something a moderately “good” person would think. There is
                    clearly a lack of motivation, a sort of encouragement in spending time at a
                    place so mundane, it could hardly ever be described as “meaningful” in
                    traditional sense of the word, where the partaker looks for some impact to
                    be made in the physical world so as to describe the work done in terms of
                    the results obtained from their actions.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    The good thing about this thought is that there is an understanding that
                    avoiding the task at hand does not align with the moral compass that
                    accepts abandoning of one’s duties as a sincerely dickish thing to do.

                <p class="verse">
                    This is just the first part of a natural prayer which translates a passing
                    thought into a conversational sentence with a definite structure – the
                    first part of which addresses the recipient of the thought, ie, God. Then,
                    there is a description of the tiny dilemma at hand, which has lead the
                    thinker towards the recipient. Then there is some optional background
                    information on why the said dilemma is a problem in the first place.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    The words “It just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do” are optional in
                    the sense that God is all-knowing, so He knows why you are having a problem
                    with this mundane decision. It is important that you know the reason too,
                    as it only goes to show how self-aware you are.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    The more self-aware you are, the better will your conversations will be
                    with the Divine. After the first part of describing the dilemma, there
                    comes the <em>Ask</em>. It describes what it is that you really want in the
                    moment – everything else in the universe remaining constant – all you
                    bigger, introspective problems aside – what would you have God do to bring
                    you at ease:

                <p class="verse">
                    This part can get very tricky. You can ask for the tiniest thing like the
                    disappearance of a fly that has been bothering you, to the bigger problems
                    of making your work impactful to millions of people and “fixing” the
                    disastrous existence that you call a life.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    At best, this is a very tiny nudge that distracts you from your problem at
                    hand, and allows you to breathe a little without being distracted by said
                    problem – so that moments later, you can refocus on your task in a much
                    better way.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    This may seem like a distraction in the moment, but that’s almost always
                    what God gives you, a distraction from pain, so that you heal and emerge
                    much more powerful, and much more motivated to tackle the problem that had
                become the bane of your existence – all by yourself,	<em>with a little bit of his help</em>.

                <p class="verse">
                    After the Ask, comes the Why – here you outline the result that you would
                    like to see after a successfully answered prayer. Again, God, the
                    all-knowing, knows what’s in your heart. He knows you better than you know
                    yourself, so it is obvious that He will give you a result that you truly
                    need. This part is important for the same reason – it’s better if you know
                    what YOU need. If the results of His actions align with what you had wished
                    for, won’t you be much happier with the results?

                    I believe this is a given, but <strong>do not lie at all</strong> in this
                    short prayer thinking that you saying certain things will guarantee certain
                    results. Just because something is “expected” from the good people of a
                    time and place, doesn’t mean that that’s what you should aspire to say in
                    your most private thoughts.

                    Now that you know the structure of this natural prayer, let’s unravel the
                    general thought behind all of them. Every small prayer loosely translates
                    to:
                <br/><br/>
                    “Dear God, I recognise that I’m just a lowly earthly being, stuck living a
                    regular life. I don’t want to ask for much here, I’m not looking for some
                    greater meaning in what I am doing. I also, wouldn’t ask you for a bunch of
                    worldly possessions that I know I don’t really need because I know you’re
                    not a genie, and genies aren’t real. What I want is not beyond the realm of
                    possibilities – all I ask is for a little nudge that makes this mandatory
                    mundane activity a little more encouraging so I can spend my free time in a
                    better manner with the people I cherish most in the world.”

                Over these past millennia, what is the	<strong>one defining trait that has made us truly human</strong>? Is is our
                    propensity for infinite progress? That one has put us in the mess that we
                    find ourselves in; so that can’t be it. Is it our desire to continually
                    improve? That almost inevitably lends us to failures and disappointments. 
                    Is it then our want of a better life, no matter what the emotional,
                    spiritual, and mental cost? That statement in itself sounds very wrong. Is
                    it our empathy, or lack thereof? Other animated string complexes have that,
                    so that doesn’t make us unique.

                <p class="verse">
                    What does, however, make us unique, is our undying curiosity – one that
                    leads us down Frostian less-travelled paths. It’s not our penchant for the
                    shiny new thing that everybody else has,
                    <em>
                        it is our desire to have unfettered access to unexplored territories
                        and untested ideas that leads us to chartering paths where none ever
                        existed before</em>.

                    History is proof – for narrow is the path, and smaller still, is the gate
                    that lends to life itself. In the beginning, like most things, it is hard
                    to follow, but if you keep on going, and keep on wishing with your mind and
                    soul, you may just find what you were looking for, and receive all that you
                    hadn’t thought of asking for.

                <p class="verse">
                    To understand the meaning of curiosity, and by development of it – intelligence, what we really have to do, is go
                    back to Aristotle – that is – do you want to understand what is an
                intelligent action, or what is the<strong> source and medium</strong> that	<em>guides</em> us towards intelligent action?

                    It has been written that, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
                    with God, and the Word was God.” The line after this has caused some
                    confusion, and because religion is no place for brevity – it calls for
                    questioning and elaboration. The next line goes – “In the beginning was
                    God, and God was with the Word, and God was the Word.” This is not the
                    version you’ll find in any Bible <em>yet</em> published, but I know this
                    interpretation is correct. <em>So I have been told.</em>
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Too big of a digression? I don’t think so. Let’s draw a parallel: In the
                    beginning there was material energy, and this material energy was one with
                    the informational energy – they weren’t two parts of a whole – they were
                indeed one – as much as anything and nothing there ever was – this was	<em>the one</em> – the sheer nothingness and completeness before the ‘Big
                    Bang.’
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    On the subject of the catalyst, or the cause for this Big Bang, I have no
                    answers. <em>I didn’t ask</em>. What good would it do? My mind was already
                    in shock after the magnitude of information I had received, that I just
                    couldn’t risk taking in more of it. It has taken over two years for me to
                    recover from that intake, and it is for the first time that, now, I can
                    conjure up concrete words to articulate what I have received. 
                    It will have taken me thirteen more years to finish explaining what I
                    essentially absorbed over six weekends. A lot can happen in 42 days, and a
                    lot happened in an instant all those billion(s) years ago.

                <p class="verse">
                    I didn’t say that God is material energy and this Word thing is something
                    else – quite the opposite –
                    <em>
                        there is nothing but God, there is no God, but Allah, Allah is
                        Bhagwaan, and Bhagwaan is Rabb, and Rabb is Khuda
                    </em> . It’s all the same – it is all a part of the one.

                <p class="verse">
                    There is nothing but this one – all things, material or purely
                    informational, are part of this one. God is a force. He’s also an energy.
                    He is also a gigantic particle. He is also the filter through which we look
                    at life and perceive Heaven and Hell. <strong>God is the <em>Universal Relay </em>
                    that controls the <em>intensity</em> of all that you experience</strong>.

                    What God is, that the Guru Granth Sahib will tell you, as God, in His
                    entirety, is indescribable. You have to see Him, and experience His
                    presence and even then your mind can only conjure up simplistic clichés to
                    describe Him. The <em>Gurbani</em> goes on for over 1400 pages describing
                    God, yet it hardly does justice in being comprehensive about His work. Gurbani
                    is lengthy, but not exhaustive by any means.

                <p class="verse">
                The most important thing that it does mention is, that	<em>God is complete</em>. He is complete without humans. The omnipresent,
                    all powerful being/particle is well suited to reside in this universe all
                    by Himself. He does not need you, some times, because of our negative
                    actions, He does not even want you.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    He accepts that you exist, and hence, being the forever generous being that
                    He is, He wants to help you in whatever way you will let Him – because you,
                me, all of what you see and experience around you, is a part of Him.	<em>Life itself, is the universe experiencing itself.</em>

                    To reiterate, material and informational energy form all that there is –
                    and this entire system is God. Stay with Me long enough, and I’ll prove
                    that this (Matter/Information) Energy paradigm that you have considered
                inanimate and non-living for so long because of your	<em>belief in opposition</em> to the ‘God Delusion’ is nothing but hokum,
                    and life itself, is just the Source experiencing itself.

                    Language is the most important tool for any sentient being. It forms the
                    structural scaffolding for mental frames. Moreover, not only is every
                    formal or working theory of science and mathematics by definition a
                    language, but science and mathematics in whole and in sum are languages.

                    Every piece of information that can be received or imparted, including

                    description of (Material/Informational) Energy and therefore qualifies as a
                    language. It is a fact, that every animated knotted string complex
                    constantly uses language to explain itself, the world around it, and the

                    made up of matter and perceived as information. To that extent, even the
                    very laws of nature are a language unto themselves – waiting to be

                    detailed instructions from which elements and <em>offsprings</em> of nature
                cannot deviate. In that respect, they form a<strong>control language</strong> – a universal code – via which nature	<strong>regulates</strong> the elements and offsprings of nature.

                    This control language is not unlike the known formal coding systems of my

                    self-contained with respect to configuration, execution and read-write
                    operations (receiving and imparting information); but unlike most current
                    systems, it is infinitely recursive and each layer of understanding
                    successively unpacks another, more challenging layer like an infinity
                    onion.

                    Be careful, once you start to unpack, there will be no end – and whenever
                    you think it may have ended, there will come something so starkly ingenious
                    that all that you may have learnt before, could just as easily be discarded
                as a waste of time – but somehow –<em>the previous layers manage to stay intact</em>, to the point that your	<strong>belief in the reason for their existence</strong> strengthens even
