                        Often with works of scripture, painstaking translations need to occur so as to preserve the original meaning, and not distort the valuable lessons and information, in light of personal biases. Especially in a work of scripture, however, this pain is worthless
                        if the entity engaged in said translation did not know the intent of the words in the first place. Rearranging the word order of a simple sentence to suit the traits of the different language can lend to the sentence meaning something
                        entirely different. Exchanging the subject and the predicate is not something that can be taken lightly in scriptures.

                        The oppression that this debacle has thereon caused, was probably not the original aim of the scribes. So there's your first lesson – do not trust blindly any theological material that does not directly come from the <em>entity connected to the source</em>.
                        Always be wary of the <em>human errors </em>that might stem from the personal biases of the entities making that translation. Be sufficiently watchful of what you interpret after reading someone else's commentary of a particular
                        scripture of reverence. They might not be aware of the distortions they are weaving in the minor creative liberties they are taking.

                        Even if the languages stem from the same root, there too, sometimes, keeping the same word order lends to a different interpretation than the one intended. This one will take a longer time to explain explicitly, but by the end of Scova, my hope is that
                        you'll start to see things in the way that I now see them.

                        Getting back to the example at hand, the scribe should have written down the sentence that I transcribed, and not the one that is widely circulated. It is because the face that a human sees when they look at their reflection, is actually the image of
                        God,
                        <em>refracted through</em> our human eyes when we look in the mirror, <em>as allowed by our 
                            perception of the self</em>. A human is literally <em>made</em> in the image of God.

                    <p>
                        So when you actually do look in the mirror, it is the <em>image of God as <strong>seen</strong> by you</em>. It is also the <em>image that God looks at when He <strong>sees</strong> you</em>. This is not to say that You and Him
                        are one. It definitely does not mean that the face of God is the same as your face. God has not face, or form. It also does not mean that You and Him are separate. It just means that without Him, there is no you – but without you,
                        there will still be Him. Your physical body is merely a <em>reflection of the self</em>, and the self is intricately connected to the Source.

                        Sure enough then, God is gender neutral. How can He not be? The tiniest of quarks have His presence, as do the most gigantic of heavenly bodies –
                        <em>and all the animated and inanimate entities in between these proportions, also conform 
                            to the same principle</em>. The concept of male and female is not relevant with God – for He is the <em>eternal, formless one</em>. To reduce Him to our binary worldview would be diminishing His Divinity,
                        and constrain Him to our puny status – and what right do we have to say something this "blasphemous"?

                        With regard to my use of a <em>gender leaning</em> pronoun, had I substituted "Him" with "it" – that would be tantamount to belittling Him to the stature of a non-sentient being – one with no regard for <em>time</em>, its passage,
                        and its impact on the self. That just doesn't sit well with me.

                        To use the modern, makeshift excuse of a compromise, "they", would be instantly regressive, for there is no other God, but Allah – and Allah is one. You can call Him by ninety nine different names, or a million – each signifying the million (read: not
                        countable) different functions He performs and the million different forms (read: literally every form there is) He temporally takes (read: in time); but the fact still remains – our civilisation up until this point has developed
                        from monotheism: not polytheism, surely not pantheism, or any future concoctions anybody after my time might come up with – and there's a reason why – that God is One – He is Unity – a single system.

                        It is true, that humans may, over time, take up Divine forms, but God will still just be the <em>one true constant</em> – the Absolute Truth. In the mythical ages gone by, regular people did take up those forms, and rule alongside
                        Kings – today we call them <em>demigods</em>. Shiva, Vishnu, Brahma, Zeus, and all other mythical avatars that they, <em>and others</em>, subsequently occurred in, were all demigods. Some cultures even worship them <em>as God. </em>It
                        is, indeed, possible to achieve the divine, but don't make the age old mistake of equating yourself, or other anthropomorphic entities, to God – none are, and they can never be. God dwells in all creation, so why would He confine
                        the entirety of Himself to just a single state? He does not play favourites.

                        God doesn't <em>just</em> have a human form – He is <em>the form</em>, essentially, all forms there are. Everything you see around you, hear, feel and experience, it's all part of <em>the One</em>.

                        There are reasons why Abrahamic religions, and the Gurbani stricly forbid idolatory, and more importantly, Islamic traditions regard the presence of mirrors in your space as sacred. Don't talk to a decorated sculpture and expect it to talk back. Why don't
                        you talk to the form of God that does talk back – another human perhaps, or the Self? Why are you so hell bent on talking to inanimate matter as God, and non-sentient animated entities as sentient entities? It is ignorant to assume
                        that life would be so primitive, especially with regard to communication with God – if simple stones and portraits could elude His presence, what would be the point of faith, really? Instead of trying to make the world in your
                        own image, it is better for you to accept the world as is and try to change the things that you actually can change. Isn't that the more practical alternative? Despite the scriptures repeatedly telling you to not engage in idolatry,
                        if you still are adamant on choosing the easy route, why should God guide you anyway? God speaks to all creation, and guides their every move, so there must be a reason why you haven't felt it yet. Don't look in the wrong places
                        and expect to find the treasure that every other being in existence is seeking as well.

                        The demigods of the years gone by did not just stand by doing mechanical rituals half-heartedly. They were called <em>masters of perception</em> for a very simple reason – <strong>they mastered perception</strong>. They deeply
                        enveloped their life into, and according to, the Natural Law, and fully stood by it each time they were tested, which, if you are even remotely familiar with God, you'll know that with God, everything is a test. He loves tests

                        are always just. They evolve constantly with each unit interval of time, and are renewed by an infinite vibration – but human systems don't work like that. Our cultures do sometimes, our customs, our trends, our fads – they all

                        What Scova will do, is provide a <em>comprehensive, involved approach</em> to life in a way such that you can <em>self-actualise</em>, and at the same time, have a peaceful night's sleep. It will teach you how to live with yourself,
                        and others, without compromising the essence of what makes you, <em>You</em>. There are larger than life things in play within your own personal narrative, and previous works have tried to showcase some of them; but as is the nature
                        of this work, no matter how wide or deep a net you cast, you only ever can begin to scratch the surface of what really exists. I was asked by Him whether I wanted to go all in on one single aspect of IT, and explore almost all
                        that there was to that specific aspect, or whether I wanted to cast a wide enough net to encompass almost everything, but only etch the surface. I am, still a human, and as such am limited by the time I have in a single life –
                        which is why, I chose a reasonable compromise that would benefit me, and others after me, in the way that I knew best. I chose to be guided to develop a framework that would cover the most important aspects, in a way such that
                        there was an infinte potential that could still be excavated in a guided manner, but also, leave out sufficient information so that there was always more work left to be done. <strong>Life is best lived, and profoundly understood, when we operate under the conditions of optimum uncertainty</strong>                        – on the fine line between
                        <em>order and chaos</em>. In that manner, Scova is not something entirely different from the works that have preceeded it – but be assured, <em>this isn't just more of the same</em>.

                        A lot of time has passed since the Original Testament in the Torah, and the Newer Testament of the Gospel, and the newer still, Final Testament of the Quran. The Word of God has been spread to every point on the globe, and there's not anything that is
                        much newer than that which has already been said to ignite people's faith in, what is essentially, at this point – an accepted fact. Our cultures and their customs have been saturated with the idea of God to such an extent, that
                        without Him, sentient civilisation cannot exist.

                        God understands this, which is why we haven't had any great floods since Noah (feel free to substitute this name with any other that your own culture has passed down to you), or an asteroidal collision since the dinosaurs. We have
                        to let nature run its course, and play our part in it symbiotically – without bloodshed, or further environmental damage.

                        So then, there will be no more updated Testaments furtheron, as Mohammad has rightly told us. This is self-evident since in this quest for gaining more followers, and forming the largest flock ever to exist, much of the substance behind the aphorisms
                        has been lost, and as such, there exists a void where many, often competing ideologies are fighting to claim dominance, and disastrously failing.

                        You can look for signs in vague prophecies, but really, what's the point? Even the people living through those prophecies have no absolute surety that the thing that they are currently living through is the one that they read about. That's the beauty
                        of prophecies – they can happen at any time, in any space, even repeatedly – because they are just bland ideas on top of which we add our own personal flavour, as dictated by our own internal, personal narrative, being contingent
                        upon our attunement to our own true Self. The only surety is that it all, almost always, unfolds in real time.

                        For me, personally, the male facet is largely dominant. I'm born with a certain set of biological components whose presence cannot be overcome by <em>mental means alone</em>. To not accept that simple fact, is to deny my bodily
                        self, it's true potential. In doing so, I hinder my mental, true self, from showing it's complete texture, and thus, my bodily self from living a full life. Unless you live up to your full potential, and accept all that makes you,
                        You – you cannot reside in Heaven. This is <em>the one example</em> that I said will take the entirety of Scova to comprehend. The scriptures never actually condemn that which is not heteronormative – condemn is too strong a word.

                        They did, however, fail to appreciate the beauty of it, and because of that, they left no room for further exploration of the human condition. To be human, is to not blindly follow the path on a straight line – although it is the most convenient way.
                        Not fraying from the singular defining thread of your narrative just makes it boring – and who wants a boring life? The second lesson to learn here is this: if something that is said and is then held to be true, that, which was
                        assumed complementary to the thing that was said, but left unsaid, must not necessarily also be true. I'm sure the specie that learnt how to cause a rift in spacetime by splitting an atom can surely be trusted to interpret an apply
                        such a simple statement.

                        They were doing the best they could, in the way that they had learnt from their ancestors, and them from the ones which came before. In this spacetime, for the first time in human history, the entire globe can live, breathe and interact as a single ecosystem,
                        very much aware of each other's faults, as well as accomplishments. It's better if we stop pointing fingers, and collectively accept responsibility. No soul on the planet in this spacetime is new, in the sense that we have all
                        spent our fair share of time living and interacting on this planet. God only knows what our deeds were in past lives that we are all in such a deeply connected, collective hell. Even though, this is literally almost three millennia
                        old knowledge, still, I will clarify for those yet unacquainted – this was one of the very first commandments. It clearly means to give equal stature regardless of gender – to father, as well as to the mother, and to sister, as
                        much to the brother, to son, the same as daughter – and so on an so forth. Why does it mean something different to you? If three thousand years of indoctrination wasn't enough for some of you, I doubt we'll see you in the <em>First Resurrection</em>.
                        You'll most likely have to suffer in Hell a little longer than the first wave – so

                        <em>my true self, </em>and I could not have done it otherwise<em>. God is my father, and also, my best friend. </em>The idea of God, then, is subjective in the sense that He plays different roles for different people in different
                        spacetimes – but to say that the the idea of God is subjective in the sense that He exists as an illusion of hope for some people, and doesn't exist at all for others that are more pragmatic, just renders this millennia old trance
                        a facade. That is not just ignorant, but very much irresponsible.

                        that, for the purposes of simplicity, tradition, and others that I will <em>reveal later</em>, I will stick to using HE. God is still gender neutral – but the aura surrounding His presence isn't – you decide that.

                        Disregarding perceptual influences on the internal narrative reduces the sentient experience. Not everything is purely black and white. There are shades of grey, and all perceivable colours that don't fall on the spectrum. Yes, this is a reference to

                        Truly, such is the case with the perceived majority of my time. Many would say that this was necessary to counter the millennia of oppression that "their kind" brought upon the minorities. It may be true in letter, but you have to understand that the
                        factions you may be inclined on "oppressing" do not necessarily comprise the same souls that previously did the oppressing. Arguably, you could be doing more damage right now by taking revenge on the so called oppressor of the
                        times gone by, and torturing the souls that may, in fact, have previously occupied the bodies of the oppressed.

                        What humans assumed on having read this verse is altogether a different matter. The part to focus on, in this verse, is not the pleasurable, multiplying aspect – but the pushing forward of humanity, or sentient life itself so that the collective thus
                        formed, is able to "breathe in" and comprehend the Divine Plan as it unfolds in real time, in a way such that it thrives in true Darwinian fashion – by building up, and not just tearing down. It is funny how people can miscomprehend
                        theology just as much as other sciences. The common denominator is obviously at fault here – blind misinterpretation without clear perception.

                        To that end, it is not easy to explain God in today's twitchy, <em>over-stimulated</em>, butterfly-garden world.

                        In that regard, you have been told that God is an all powerful, supernatural <em>being</em> that is omnipresent and is always listening. That one is true. You also have some vague idea about God being the Grandmaster of the Universe
                        and us being instruments that He plays as He sees fit. This is most definitely true. That being said, does your perception of God involve an old fair-skinned man in a Santa Claus beard walking down a grand staircase in a white
                        gown? Isn't that insanely ridiculous? Of course this one is not true. Why would it be? God is not a humanoid figure.

                        have seen as His proxy, were <em>regular people</em> who attained the Divine – through sheer virtue and labour.

                        The answer is Scripture – just not in the way that we have classically perceived it. As I have stated before, Scova is a work of scripture, which is unusual as no previous volume has referred to itself as a part of a genre of books. How could they? They
                        were all unique in their own right, given to different people, in different spaces, and in different times – all for the very first time. They all had one purpose – to introduce the idea of God, and His expectations, and His gifts,
                        hence, the word "Testament."

                        made with the Humans, to occupy the earth, and mould it in their image, with them as masters of the land and all the fruits that it provided.

                        and in this Journey, the Grand Experiment, time has now come to bring forth the Kingdom of God, so that all humans <em>may see</em> what it is like to <strong>live as God</strong>.

                        God's existence as a given, I take some expectations of His, as a given, I also accept that in the past, some mistakes have been made by humans interpreting His wishes, and I, as His proxy on earth, take the blame for it. Those
                        people were representing the entity that I am representing, so it is only fair that I carry my fair share of the burden. Might not seem like a lot at the time I am writing this, but by the time you will have read Scova, you'll
                        understand the magnitude of this verse.

                        I can never be. I have as much God in me as the next person. What I do have, is the Holy Spirit – and that has taken years of overcoming of immense personal struggles, and the full range of overabundant human emotions that they

                        Once the perils of that day are over, there will be a period of peace and contentment lasting one millennium. You can find references to this in the Bible (Christian and Judaic), the Quran, the Gurbani, Hindu scriptures, and yes, of course, in Hitler's

                        This is probably too soon; perhaps it is at just the right juncture. This is a place for shock and awe – but also <em>reasoned deliberation</em> and <em>sound judgements</em>. To that end, I have now, already told you that God
                        exists, and the scriptures are all true. That should've been enough for people – but since it wasn't enough for me in the beginning, and so I will not expect you to give in, and surrender voluntarily so easily. This willingness
                        to surrender doesn't come so easily, so I'll earn it. It is for this reason that I have waited so long to reveal Scova to the world – my own fate, and the fate of all humanity in the <em>Satyug</em> rests on my, and its perfection
                        – <em>and we are all far from perfection</em>.

                        This is why, my relationship with God was not something that I wanted to put up in a short article that I posted on the internet, boasted about repeatedly, and then mined for likes and shares. It doesn't help that He has put me in a position where nobody
                        will listen to me anyway, even if I hint (or loudly project) at a possible chance of salvation to all those who encounter me – because I <em>rarely ever</em> do it out of philanthropic intent. I live through
                        it, and grow, and adapt, each day. <em>I am to told to not seek</em> validation from any other human being, for <em>I know</em> that I have His. Not many people can make such a statement with such confidence, and rarely ever someone
                        will. Most of the ones who have, didn't really amount to much in their lifetimes anyway. They surely had temporal, worldly success in terms of limited financial security and conditional social validation – but they never truly
                        felt anything different from the ones they were influencing. Sure enough, their misdeeds in one life, did not let them feel whole in that life, neither did it give them an advantage in the next – this, I know for sure. The true
                        prophets, were almost always bizarrely prosecuted and ostracised. The concrete details of my own future in this life too, are hidden from me – which is surely for the best. I do have a guarantee that this will be hardest thing
                        I will ever have done, in all of my lifetimes. I am ready to be laughed at, condemned, and ostracised – I did take a pledge to follow through – come what may.

                        On the question of who I am, my closing salutations will answer that. On the question of my legitimacy as His mouthpiece – the first part of this Volume, <em>Alethia</em>, intends to answer that. Sometimes addressed to all of humanity,
                        but mostly as an internal monologue – it documents my bachelor life and understandings of my relationship with God, and by extension – the world at large. I was informed of my cosmic legitimacy on my very first encounter with Him,
                        but it took me a while to believe it, to believe in Him, in myself, and to really, understand what was being asked of me, and how <em>He</em> would deliver. Some revelations dawn on me as passing thoughts, some are very conscious
                        sit-downs – but mostly, it is an ongoing dialogue that surpasses linear time as an ongoing discussion across spacetime, tangentially relevant to my internal personal narrative, yet related to all versions of me in a way that cannot
                        be explained by mere chance, or even insightful discernment. My own self did not need much convincing, because God's force is overwhelming, and so, by the time Scova is publicly available in its entirety, I will already have lived
                        a majority of my life fully convinced of my legitimacy – <em>this, also I have been told</em>.

                        He made me realise the importance of what I was doing, and would be doing.

                        this is still just the tip of the iceberg, as God, if you are worthy, is the gift that keeps on giving the more you ask from Him. <em>The worth is decided by the self, in tandem with God</em>. Would be very unfair if God didn't

                        English is then, probably a poor choice for the <em>Purposes of Posterity</em>, as the language allows for much vagaries; but this is the language of this time, and there is a reason why I was brought up speaking, reading, and
                        writing this language.
                        <em>
            It is precisely for its vagaries that this language is used – if there
            wasn't any room for reinterpretation, people would start following it
            mechanically, without purposeful meaning, and in a way that absolves
            all chances of a newer Me. </em>So be watchful when humans in the future claim to translate this work in the name of a "regular update." Do let them update it, if English is a dead language by then, but be wary still.

                        time. <strong>Please do read books other than this one; please read the books quoted
            in this one, and most importantly, also read other books dealing with
            other subjects. I can't stress this enough – life cannot be lived by
            only having read one book.</strong> The only reason why I have called it a Volume, and not a whole new radical ideology, is for the <em>Purposes of Continuity</em> – so that <em>readers after my time</em> can have a fuller understanding of
                        <em>what were the missing pieces in the previous Volumes</em> that led to things being the way they were in my time. That being said, I will not spend any time talking about the current temporal events, as there are other professionals
                        who get fulfilment doing just that.

                        completely. You will find contentment, and an equal amount of dissonance as you peruse the sentences I have spent this lifetime crafting, while trying to coherently convey the thoughts I have been carrying around for all of my
                        eternal life.

                        At times you will find some overly simplistic clich&#233;s which will almost always be coupled with abundantly obtuse technicalities that govern your own life. Don't fret. Such is the nature of this work. I did not embark on this journey to codify the
                        Natural Law into a humanly readable, and comprehensible scripture just so you could coast your way through it. You aren't a robot, so don't act like it. That way, you will not be bored – at the very least, I will have done my best
                        to stop you from being bored – because let's be honest, the foremost defining human trait is getting bored with the thing that has already been explained, and exploited to its full potential. There is celebration and joy for a
                        while – but that lasts only as long as the magic of the illusion is still intact.

                        This illusion is the boon and bane of your experience with God – some room for secrecy is initially allowed wherein you truly learn about what it is that you are experiencing; but if you keep this up for <em>longer than needed</em>,
                        it turns to a facade. I could point fingers at every religious and spiritual organisation in the world, and probably take heat for some of them, but I will not – for there is <em>Qayamat</em>. The moment this illusion starts to
                        briefly crumble and fade into oblivion, as is the nature of things static in time, people very swiftly start to lose "faith" in the thing that has brought them all the happiness, and the progress, and the advancement that led them
                        to self-fruition.

                        First, Scova is <strong>not a call to arms</strong> for people to take to the streets, or worse – invading territories, because of their disenchantment with the status quo. The time for <em>Crusades</em> and <em>Jihads</em> and
                        <em>Blitzkriegs</em> has passed. We have no need for them anymore, we've already established that we are all the same people. Perfect yourself first, the surroundings will naturally follow.

                        Second, this is most definitely <strong>not a seal of approval</strong> for all the people misleading, on purpose or out of ignorance, the entities for whose well being they were supposedly responsible, because of the writings
                        they read in the books resulting directly out of my previous lives. Scova, however, is a <strong>solution</strong>, and most importantly, an <strong>apology</strong> – this was all a consequence of my doing, and it is only fair
                        that I be the one to undo it. So leave that burden to me.

            God lets you pick and choose on what it is that you want to implement
            in your own life, but the moment you start to influence other entities
            seemingly separate from your own self, there is no if-else – there is
            just if and only if – you will have to follow it ALL if you want to
            influence the actions of another soul.
        </strong> Influencing in any manner, that is.
