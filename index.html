                        Often with works of scripture, painstaking translations need to occur so as to preserve the original meaning, and not distort the valuable lessons and information, in light of personal biases. Especially in a work of scripture, however, this pain is worthless
                        if the entity engaged in said translation did not know the intent of the words in the first place. Rearranging the word order of a simple sentence to suit the traits of the different language can lend to the sentence meaning something
                        entirely different. Exchanging the subject and the predicate is not something that can be taken lightly in scriptures.

                        The oppression that this debacle has thereon caused, was probably not the original aim of the scribes. So there's your first lesson – do not trust blindly any theological material that does not directly come from the<em>entity connected to the source</em>.
                        Always be wary of the <em>human errors </em>that might stem from the personal biases of the entities making that translation. Be sufficiently watchful of what you interpret after reading someone else's commentary of a particular
                        scripture of reverence. They might not be aware of the distortions they are weaving in the minor creative liberties they are taking.

                        Even if the languages stem from the same root, there too, sometimes, keeping the same word order lends to a different interpretation than the one intended. This one will take a longer time to explain explicitly, but by the end of Scova, my hope is that
                        you'll start to see things in the way that I now see them.

                        Getting back to the example at hand, the scribe should have written down the sentence that I transcribed, and not the one that is widely circulated. It is because the face that a human sees when they look at their reflection, is actually the image of
                        God,
                        <em>refracted through</em> our human eyes when we look in the mirror, <em>as allowed by our 
                            perception of the self</em>. A human is literally <em>made</em> in the image of God.

                        So when you actually do look in the mirror, it is the <em>image of God as <strong>seen</strong> by you</em>. It is also the <em>image that God looks at when He <strong>sees</strong> you</em>. This is not to say that You and Him
                        are one. It definitely does not mean that the face of God is the same as your face. God has not face, or form. It also does not mean that You and Him are separate. It just means that without Him, there is no you – but without you,
                        there will still be Him. Your physical body is merely a <em>reflection of the self</em>, and the self is intricately connected to the Source.

                        Sure enough then, God is gender neutral. How can He not be? The tiniest of quarks have His presence, as do the most gigantic of heavenly bodies –
                        <em>and all the animated and inanimate entities in between these proportions, also conform 
                            to the same principle</em>. The concept of male and female is not relevant with God – for He is the <em>eternal, formless one</em>. To reduce Him to our binary worldview would be diminishing His Divinity,
                        and constrain Him to our puny status – and what right do we have to say something this "blasphemous "?

                        and its impact on the self. That just doesn't sit well with me.

                        To use the modern, makeshift excuse of a compromise, "they ", would be instantly regressive, for there is no other God, but Allah – and Allah is one. You can call Him by ninety nine different names, or a million – each signifying the million (read: not
                        countable) different functions He performs and the million different forms (read: literally every form there is) He temporally takes (read: in time); but the fact still remains – our civilisation up until this point has developed
                        from monotheism: not polytheism, surely not pantheism, or any future concoctions anybody after my time might come up with – and there's a reason why – that God is One – He is Unity – a single system.

                        It is true, that humans may, over time, take up Divine forms, but God will still just be the <em>one true constant</em> – the Absolute Truth. In the mythical ages gone by, regular people did take up those forms, and rule alongside
                        Kings – today we call them <em>demigods</em>. Shiva, Brahma, Zeus, and all other mythical avatars that they, <em>and others</em>, subsequently occurred in, were all demigods. Some cultures even worship them <em>as God. </em>It
                        is, indeed, possible to achieve the divine, but don't make the age old mistake of equating yourself, or other anthropomorphic entities, to God – none are, and they can never be. God dwells in all creation, so why would He confine
                        the entirety of Himself to just a single state? He does not play favourites.

                        enveloped their life into, and according to, the Natural Law, and fully stood by it each time they were tested, which, if you are even remotely familiar with God, you'll know that with God, everything is a test. He loves tests
                        – just not the kind of mechanical, rote-learning standardised tests that we are all used to. These tests are innately personal, require complete surrender, and childish curiosity,<strong>insurmountable questioning</strong>, and

                        and the bane of walking this path alongside God – as He connects with each soul directly, and not via intermediaries. You can, of course, use those intermediaries as and when you please, it is why they exist.

This is why I'm here, in my spacetime, in the infamous <em>Kalyug –</em>                        the sad state of affairs on this pale blue dot in the magnificent cosmic dance. <em> I'm here for you, and I will make it all worth it</em>.

                        I was in the moment, and that's how I needed God in that moment. God is, and becomes who you need in the moment – He is formless, and so, the discussion over His gender, or lack thereof, is moot.

                        "Our Father in Heaven " is antiquity's version of <em>The Parent in Heaven</em> – people should really have adapted this with time. It's a damn shame how much oppression has been carried out in His name. It really is shameful the

                        This was one of the very first commandments. If you, as a collective, have not understood the parts which are literally almost three millennia old knowledge, what is the point of me going forward and imparting new stuff? It clearly means to give equal
                        stature regardless of gender – to father, as well as to the mother, and to sister, as much to the brother, to son, the same as daughter – and so on an so forth. Why does it mean something different to you? If three thousand years

                        What humans assumed on having read this verse is altogether a different matter. The part to focus on in this verse is not the fun, multiplying aspect – but the pushing forward of humanity, or sentient life itself so that the collective thus formed, is
                        able to "breathe in" and comprehend the Divine Plan as it unfolds in real time, in a way such that it thrives in true Darwinian fashion – by building up, and not just tearing down. It is funny how people can miscomprehend theology
                        just as much as other sciences. The common denominator is obviously at fault here – blind misinterpretation without perception.

                        To that end, it is not easy to explain God in today's twitchy, <em>over-stimulated</em>, butterfly-garden world. You can't just sum Him up in 140 characters or less; or write a cliff notes version of <em>His Manual to the Universe</em>                        just because we think we are too busy to engage ourselves in an actual discussion over the expectation of the Creator from His Creation. As the Creator of our entire universe, He does have that right of expectation over us. If
                        you do not accept that right, that's fine too – if you believe you know more about creation than the Creator Himself. Maybe you think you know more than me. Perhaps you do, I will never know. Maybe you have you own interpretation
                        – as you should. If you have you own version of events, congratulations, you are ahead of the curve, Scova will be mighty exciting for you!

                        To that end, you first need to be told how to heed to God's indications when He is trying to caution you. How do you do that? Do you pray, or do you curse? Do you shout loudly into the abyss, or do you take a vow of silence? Do you go around the world
                        looking for answers, or do you keep looking inwards? Do you take advice of learned elders, or ask an innocent child? Do you embed yourself in fervent calculations, or just toss a coin and be done with it? Do you trust your internal

                        why is there still suffering? What's the missing variable?

                        The answer is Scripture – just not in the way that we have classically perceived it. As I have stated before, Scova is a work of scripture, which is unusual as no previous volume has referred to itself as a part of a genre of books. How could they? They
                        were all unique in their own right, given to different people, in different spaces, and in different times – all for the very first time. They all had one purpose – to introduce the idea of God, and His expectations, and His gifts,
                        hence, the word "Testament."

                        Like I had also said, Scova is not yet another Testament, nor is it any cheap rebranding of the same, now mundane, ideology that has already saturated the collective consciousness. It is much more than that – it is the renewal of the "Covenant," that
                        God made with the Humans, to occupy the earth, and mould it in their image, with them as masters of the land and all the fruits that it provided.

                        Come to think of it, all great books that garnered a considerable following were written under <em>Divine Inspiration</em>. Over time, God has graciously guided us to education, to governance, and ultimately, to self-reliance,
                        and in this Journey, the Grand Experiment, time has now come to bring forth the Kingdom of God, so that all humans may see what it is like to live as God.

                        Like a parent handing over their life's work to their children, God has guided every step of the way, and so it would be mighty stupid to go astray when we have come this far, together. This is why, in Scova, I take God's existence as a given, I take
                        some expectations of His as a given, I also accept that in the past, some mistakes have been made by humans interpreting His wishes, and I, as His proxy on earth, take the blame for it. Those people were representing the entity

                        I have garnered some knowledge which has come directly from Him, and in Scova, I will have done my best to quell any doubts and misconceptions that will eventually arise in the minds of the people. Mind you, <em> I am not God</em>,

                        This knowledge, and these thoughts <em>don't always </em>have to do with spirituality or the foundation of <em>yet another religion</em>.

                        There's a reason why every religious book of consequence revolves around this time period – it's coming, and the events that precede it. Some even document the afterwards, calling it the recurring four <em>Yugs</em> or eras. Those

                        Would you then, much later into the future, not focus on the world at large, but try to confine people to their close social circle and tell them to focus on just those key elements in their life by <strong>living your own life for them to see as an example</strong>                        – so that they may be inclined to try for themselves, and taste the <em>manna</em> that He so graciously, benevolently provides?

                        Of course you could question the single person's aims, ambitions, and methods of operation for carrying out this mammothly impossible task – you could maybe judge them in a legal court and declare them certifiably, pathologically psychopathic – or you

                        It is now, in this time, that we are all finally in a state where we can comprehend truly, equally, without, and beyond a shred of doubt – that <em>we aren't Gods</em>. We can't possibly be. Look around

                        Once the perils of that day are over, there will be a period of peace and contentment lasting one millennium. You can find references to this in the Bible (Christian and Judaic), the Quran, the Gurbani, Hindu scriptures, and yes, of course, in Hitler's

                        On the question of who I am, my closing salutations will answer that. On the question of my legitimacy as His mouthpiece – the first part of this Volume, <em>Alethia</em>, intends to answer that. Sometimes addressed to all of humanity,

                        English is then, probably a poor choice for the <em>Purposes of Posterity</em>, as the language allows for much vagaries; but this is the language of this time, and there is a reason why I was brought up speaking, reading, and
                        writing this language.

            all chances of a newer Me.

                        You might be wondering that if this is a book of scripture, then why am I going out of my way to exclude some people who I haven't personally met? Hasn't religion always been a place for acceptance? Doesn't God love and accept all His children? To that

                        is a place for acceptance of all beings alike, but <em>religion is established by humans</em>, and humans have limits, so do their constructs. Those limits being clearly defined across spacetime as

                        To that end, you will find in Scova, a lot that you agree with, and an equal amount of disagreement. You will also find things that you already know in your own peculiar ways, and equally, you shall find things that you thought you knew, but did not understand
                        completely. You will find contentment, and an equal amount of dissonance as you peruse the sentences I have spent this lifetime crafting, while trying to coherently convey the thoughts I have been carrying around for all of my
                        eternal life.

                        At times you will find some overly simplistic clich&#233;s which will almost always be coupled with abundantly obtuse technicalities that govern your own life. Don't fret. Such is the nature of this work. I did not embark on this journey to codify the
                        Natural Law into a humanly readable, and comprehensible scripture just so you could coast your way through it. You aren't a robot, so don't act like it.

                        That way, you will not be bored – at the very least, I will have done my best to stop you from being bored – because let's be honest, the foremost defining human trait is getting bored with the thing that has already been explained, and exploited to its
                        full potential. There is celebration and joy for a while – but that lasts only as long as the magic of the illusion is still intact.

                        This illusion is the boon and bane of your experience with God – some room for secrecy is initially allowed wherein you truly learn about what it is that you are experiencing; but if you keep this up for <em>longer than needed</em>,
                        it turns to a facade. I could point fingers at every religious and spiritual organisation in the world, and probably take heat for some of them, but I will not – for there is <em>Qayamat</em>.

                        The moment the illusion starts to briefly crumble and fade into oblivion, as is the nature of things, people very swiftly start to lose "faith" in the thing that has brought them all the happiness, and the progress, and the advancement that led them to
                        self-fruition.

                        Adding to that, even though it is abundantly clear, I will still positively affirm a few important disclaimers that need to be made before anything with the potential to cause proper damage is revealed. People have a habit of misinterpreting what is not
                        said.

                        First, Scova is <strong>not a call to arms</strong> for people to take to the streets because of their disenchantment with the status quo. The time for <em>Crusades</em> and <em>Jihads</em> and <em>Blitzkriegs</em> has passed.
                        We have no need for them anymore, we've already established that we are all the same people. Perfect yourself first, surroundings will naturally follow.

                        Second, this is most definitely <strong>not a seal of approval</strong> for all the people misleading, on purpose or out of ignorance, the entities for whose well being they were supposedly responsible, because of the writings
                        they read in the books resulting directly out of my previous lives. Scova, however, is a <strong>solution</strong>, and most importantly, an <strong>apology</strong> – this was all a consequence of my doing, and it is only fair
                        that I be the one to undo it. So leave that burden to me.

                        Another bit of advice for those proceeding:
                        <strong>
            God lets you pick and choose on what it is that you want to implement
            in your own life, but the moment you start to influence other entities
            seemingly separate from your own self, there is no if-else – there is
            just if and only if – you will have to follow it ALL if you want to
            influence the actions of another soul.
        </strong> Influencing in any manner, that is.

                        The only true decision you will ever make is to find out what kind of a stereotype you were, and what kind of a stereotype you want to be. All the steps in between – you will have to navigate through, throughout your life, <em>almost always listening</em>                        to what He is trying to tell you, because He is always listening to You. Let this serve as a guide to wander through life in the best way only you could.
