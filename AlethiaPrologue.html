                <p class="verse">
                    Even after you will have practiced all that I <em>will have</em> preached, you will realise that God is <em>only</em> available to you for a while, that is, when you are your <em>true self</em>. You can be true to yourself in certain
                    moments, and God <em>may</em> find a way to help you experience His presence. If you are observant, which, I hope you are, you will definitely <em>sense</em> Him. Whether through your five basic senses, or as an internal force – that
                    really just depends on you. Nobody, not even I, can dictate that. No other entity can be the judge of that, and neither should you let them. His presence will linger, but it will not last forever. You can be “touched by infinity,”
                    and yet live and breathe in the same human flesh. Don’t try disappointing your <em>self</em> turning water to wine just yet.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Don’t lose faith in your self, if your skin has not turned blue, or if you have not been able to part oceans. Whether or not He has told you about your cosmic lineage, it really doesn’t matter – you don’t have the memories of those lifetimes, and you
                    never will. It doesn’t make sense then, to laud yourself or doubt your actions in this life based on your behaviour in a previous life.
                    <em>
                        God has already passed that judgement for you, so don’t do that to
                        yourself, certainly not to others.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Yes, you do have the intuition leftover from the previous lives, which will initially guide your subconscious actions, because otherwise, what sense would it make to have <em>karma</em> that out spans bodily lives and haunts you in
                    your <em>after-lives</em>? If that wasn’t the case, we would all start with the same <em>equality of opportunity</em>, and everybody would be truly born equal under Natural Law, and <em>not just</em> under law of the land. Under the
                    Natural Law, we are all born into what we <em>truly deserve</em> from our previous lives – what we become in this life, <em>that is contingent </em>upon what we do in this life – which is <em>then contingent upon</em> how attuned we
                    are with our intuition from our previous lives and of the current self. You have to <em>constantly work</em> to receive the time-tested wisdom that already is embedded within you. As always, it’s a <em>delicate balance</em> only a
                    select few truly manage to achieve.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    You could have been a ruler in your past life, but be born a pauper in the next, or a literal pig – you just can’t predict that. You can only assume. Similarly, you can make assumptions about someone’s current beginning to extrapolate their deeds in a
                    past life. They can be advantageous, or disadvantageous, as are <em>micro-deaths</em> within a single bodily life that occur at the time of sleep, or metaphorical endings that define your internal narrative – you
                    really just have to pay attention to your own life, and how it relates to, and is affected by, those around you. What they really are, are cues, for you to deliberate over as to <em>what to do in the next moment</em> as you proceed
                    further.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Instead, then, of saying that <em>I was</em> Brahma, or Shiva, or Gautam, or Adolf in my past lives, and then justifying actions of those <em>beings gone by</em> with the context of the actual future that has now, already occurred,
                    I am better equipped to explain to you, the lessons learnt from those past lives and offer a solution which provides a <em>solace in the misery of life and time</em> – because the classical model of religion with the public prayers,
                    and the ritualistic routines, and eclectic paraphernalia has definitely not worked for posterity – as it really wasn’t supposed to. If they did, we wouldn’t, as a collective, have come to accept this sordid status quo that the our
                    planet has become.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    For most of the truly <em>sentient</em> <em>organic knotted string complexes,</em> repeatedly unanswered prayers, mechanical rituals, and all the concocted formalities just do not make sense anymore. The “so-called” holy objects just seem like outdated material gizmos, meanwhile the pressure of a productive life has built up, in most occasions – close companions, acquaintances, and worthy strangers haven’t really been enough, and the socio-politico-cultural disaster of a status quo disappoints them on a regular basis, and all that they thought they found innately meaningful, just hasn’t cut it for them. Why is there still suffering, if this world could be Heaven? Surely this thought has crossed
                    your mind.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    To get to the point where I <em>will have</em> told you that you can get, you are <strong>bound</strong> to have been wronged by the world in some shape, way or form. To counter the repercussions, you are <strong>bound</strong> to have taken some shortcuts, to have found your own release activities, and designed your own rituals, and have made personal connections that I never could have <em>explicitly</em> told you about. It is what, after all is said and done, I will have been asking you to do. This <em>framework</em>, that I will have described by the end of the Alethia, is tough, but fair. It asks a lot from the person to truly be able to comprehend it, and even more to apply coherently
                    in daily life – but it is doable. I will be proof.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    So, for nobody else’s sake, but <em>your own</em>, look back, <em>reflect</em>, and ask yourself – what has been the one <strong>true constant</strong> in your life? Was it your faith? Was it your will power? Was it a person? An entity?
                    A place? An object, or an activity? Ask properly, and He will tell you. When all your rational faculties weren’t functioning properly, to their fullest extent – when <em>you</em> weren’t even your fullest self – what was the one thing
                    that gave you solace in the fact that when <em>everything else failed</em> – you would still have this one thing? This one thing <em>nudged you</em> towards hope, gave you comfort, peace, happiness, eradicated sadness, pushed your
                    body and mind when they were close to hitting rock bottom and giving up – whether as its cause, or as the catalyst that pulled you upwards, or both. God knew that this was the one thing – and so He chose this one thing to <strong>guide your hand</strong>,
                    and <em>show you your world via your connection to this one thing</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse bible"><em>
                        “Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.”

                    What if I told you that one day, all that you are, and will be and all that you will have built and nurtured in between – would come undone if you were asked to give up this one thing and you didn’t follow through? You keep it, you stay human; you <em>remove it from your life</em>, you become <em>Divine! </em>

                    See, once you attach yourself to God – <em>He has to be Your constant</em>. You can no longer serve two masters – just one – Him. You asked to be <em>one with Him</em>, so there cannot be <em>two of you</em>. One needs to give way
                    to the other. The one that’s not with God, will decimate the other, and by extension, <em>You</em>. You cannot then, just be true to yourself in private, uninterrupted moments – you have to <em>be it all the time</em>. You asked God
                    to make you sufficiently prepared – and He enlightened you. This is not something that is sought for your own little self, <em>it is given for your world</em>, and as such, you are then <strong>bound</strong> to the responsibilities

                    most of all – that your authority is recognised, accepted, and revered in the confine of your influence. It means that the inside, and the outside are in sync, and you have aligned yourself with the Grid, and the Force of Life is flowing

It is my cross to bear, but really – I <em>initially </em>just took up this responsibility in the name of a legendary life.

                    This story, if you ask me, seems almost cliched – manic kid believes himself to be Jesus – what a shocker! I would’ve agreed, had I not been that kid.

                    Empty space for God knows what.

                    So that’s why I know that despite all that I could tell you, you wouldn’t believe me – the only way you would believe it, was if you experienced it for your own self.

                <p class="verse">
                    That’s also not to say that I have always agreed with His means, or His methods, or his damned twists and tricks. For an insanely long time, I really didn’t concur. I just wasn’t ready – ready to give up my human frailties, to surrender, and to adapt.

                    Isn’t that really, the whole point of preparation? God didn’t just give me a 15 year timeline to finish a damned book, but to live a life, with all its ups and downs and all the in-betweens. I could end up writing an entirely separate book on the feelings and the emotions I have felt and end up not saying anything new at all. It has already been scrupulously documented in the Gurbani. Repeating Nanak’s Journey would really make <em>my</em> entire narrative a rerun.

                    I really do not want that. Regardless of the fact that Nanak’s approach is far from perfect to install a global umbrella for all kinds of human identities – the vane side of me wants to do, to accomplish, to achieve much more – both personally, and externally. I want to do all the things I have done in my past lives, and I want to do them better in this life. That, I believe, will give me, personally, some solace. After the truth bomb that God dropped me at the end of my 42 Day Journey, I don’t want to have this guilt of my actions from previous lives lingering around in my next life. <em>I want complete absolution.</em> What I have to do to bring my ideas into fruition requires exactly the amount of personal sacrifice that God has asked of me.

                    Just the act of being Born Again <em>once</em> in my current life wasn’t enough. It shouldn’t be enough for anyone. You have to constantly work to untangling yourself from the past, while retaining the true essence of what it is that
                    <em>has truly defined you as a soul,</em> and you have to do it in the most empathetic and considerate way you possibly can.

                <p class="verse">
                    In, and according to my own personal narrative, the most important bodies that have lived and have influenced the collective to the maximum extent, have been residencies of <em>My</em> soul – so it is only fair that I live through
                    this purgatory phase in this current life, only so that the phoenix that arises at the end of the tunnel has much more to offer to the world – much more than I, in this current, frail state could have given.

                    If I merely recorded a video to showcase all my internal conflicts, and more, I wouldn’t be doing justice to my human self who was utterly feeling lost, lonely, vulnerable, angry, disappointed, and truly ill-equipped to complete the challenge that he had been tasked with. It wouldn’t be fair to him, and neither would it be fair to you, the reader, who has hopefully picked up Scova not by force, but by choice, or lack thereof.

                    My words may often ring empty to your ears, and you may skim blindly by the rush of emotions that has <em>always</em> preceded the actual writing, but know this – I haven’t written any of this in a light-hearted laughable fashion. I have felt the literal pains – physical, emotional, psychological, and yes, financial too. I really do wish I could record the emotions and embed them within the text itself, but I can’t. If God sees fit, He may find a way to show you what I’ve been
                    through every time I have wanted to write down a single word, a coherent sentence, a relatable thought, a replicable experiment, or a verifiable theory.

                    If He doesn’t, I still know that there will be readers of Scova in a time much later than mine, who will actualise the Divine within themselves in their own intricate ways, and will inshallah be treated with the kind of regard that I wanted to be treated with when I began this whole drama. May the world be kind to the future Sons and Daughters of God.

Sometimes I did by force, mostly I did it by choice. However, when the responsibility, and the honour of <strong><em>it</em></strong> was taken away from me, I did lose my sense of Purpose. And never before, had I felt <em>truly empty – ekdum khaali</em>.

                    Without our sense of Purpose, we are really just <em>empty balloons </em> flowing in whichever direction the winds take us. Winds here has a literal meaning, as the <em>Strings of Time,</em> on which the winds move, <em>govern most of our serendipitous movements</em>. It also has a metaphoric reference to the prevailing social, economic, and political conditions of the time that guide our movements as masses. Whether you call this choice, or lack thereof of wanting to continue on the Divine path – a kind of love, or Stockholm syndrome, I leave that up to you.

The sins of the father are not the sins of the son, so why should the same hollow standard apply to virtues? In a fashion described by John over two millennia ago, God Himself, has raised me to this status, because I, by sheer <em>virtue and labour</em>, will have <strong>earned</strong> the right to call myself His Son.

I also, did not go into a manic daze, lose track of time, and return to reality days later with this title – a loose threaded theory concocted by a “medical professional” in a field that is not even a century old.
