                <p class="verse">
                    Understand that, there come a lot of points in a human’s life where the
                    person is forced to turn to no one – but their own self. At such a point,
                    vocational exercises with fellow humans do not make sense – because if they
                    had, this person wouldn’t have had been in such a hopeless, such a helpless
                    position.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    What do I know about being helpless, when all I have talked about so far, is how great my life has been, and how great God is, the all forgiving, the most gracious, the most compassionate, and that He understands – and that He accepts? What exactly does He have to understand if He Himself sent me to live, breathe, and be human? </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I know I have only talked about being His Son, His prophet, and His crazy, eccentric progeny, whatever you may want to call me, I have been all of that and more. In giving me that stature, or denying me that status because of your own predispositions, you are forgetting one critical fact – that I am only human. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I am not a non-sentient, mechanical auditor who is only here to document the human condition from afar, like an objective observer. I said in the very beginning that I have made all the mistakes firsthand, and that without my own background story – the story of Anhad, the human, the story of Anhad, the Son of God does not make sense at all. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    Unless you want to give me a special status of a divine entity, equivalent to a generous Angel, which, I know you most definitely are not inclined to give me, then, you owe it to Yourself, and your human form for having come this far into Alethia – to explore the deeper context that gave birth to this pathetic, entitled sob story that I am very much inclined to turn into a legend. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I am no Angel, be sure of that fact; and I am not God, as I have already stressed that fact enough. I have seen myself to an embodiment of Satan, whatever that being is or isn't – but the fact is, that I am human. I have laughed, cried, fought, loved, hated, despised, and engaged in all other modes of operation therein, all the while covering up my insecurities with masks as and when the situation called for them. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    This mask, this superficial persona, that we all have to put on as we traverse through the world daily – is truly the one thing that has bothered the fabric of my true being since the very origin. I mentioned in passing, that in primary school, I was a shy, wallflower type kid who was overly sensitive and cried a lot. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    Be assured, that no kid is born that way. Whether or not you find the true system of karma that outspans bodily lives fair or just – it exists, and there's not much we can do about it, except have empathy for the beings that suffer in their childhoods, and tirelessly work for the rest of their life to unfetter themselves from the chains, about the origin of which, and the existential reasons of which, they have no memories. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I have told you that on the Day of my Judgement, I was naked, afraid, embarrassed, remorseful,
                    and broken; but I didn't specified why, or how. I did not want Alethia to just be reduced to the level of a human autobiography, in a way such that either the specific details of my present life were microanalysed ad inifinitum, which would lead to their true substance being lost – because a human life is not just a set of parameters that are introduced in a linear fashion. It could also go the opposite route, which would be worse, where people started to replicate my journey mechanically – thinking that this was one sure-shot way towards salvation. Be assured, that at the time of writing this chapter too, I am not entirely free – that's why the next chapter is entitled in the way that it is. </p>
                    <p class="verse">
                        Not maintaining the proper balance between telling a detailed account of events as they occurred, and post-occurrence interpretations of said events was not something I wanted to involve in the equation. Most of what I wanted to talk about life itself, I already have said. Even still, there was left in me, a feeling of this work not being whole. </p>
                    <p class="verse">
                        Sure enough, events started to occur in my life to facilitate my thinking, and nudge me towards writing this chapter in a way I knew best, and was now, properly equipped to execute. It's only a bonus then, if readers are enticed into reading Scova because of my personal story, and not despite it. To do that, I could find no other event that has pivoted my life in a way that my Judgement Day did. It is definitely not something that should've been brushed over, and so I certainly will not be providing a sanitised account of events. I will, however, leave room for interpretation, only so that someone in this position in a later spacetime can rewrite the story with their own narrative. Hopefully scribes after my time will not alter anything in Scova to suit their own interpretations. 
                    </p>
                    <hr style="width:50%;text-align:center;border-color: black;">
                <p class="verse">

                    The first part of my description of the ill-fated event is not the most striking part of the story by any stretch of the imagination – the fact that I was naked. It is because I literally was. I have it on video, if anyone is masochistic like that, not that I would expect anyone to understand the reason why I was sitting naked, all alone in my apartment at midnight, tired to the bone, exhausted by any reasonable definition, lonely, desolate, smoking marijuana in the dark, and finally deciding to drop some LSD. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    The first part, really, is the most easy question to answer – I wanted to be as comfortable as possible. Any fabric of clothing that I had on my body, just irked me to the point that it started to interfere with my "high." In the moments I was all alone, and protected in my private oasis, I wanted nothing to do with clothes. I wanted to be as comfortable as I possibly could be in my own skin. It didn't help that I was riddled with all sorts of body image issues, and being naked in a confined space allowed me to learn to accept myself for who I truly was, and not merely what others perceived me to be, or worse – how insanely weird I perceived myself to be. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    All sorts of potential arguments could be made here about me being brown skinned in modern day America, of hailing from a post-colonial country that was at the time, only starting to wake up to the prejudices of Imperial rule that got carried forward into the colloqium, despite each human being declared equal before the law. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    In the most subtle of ways, I was made to feel less-than in a country where I most definitely did not belong – despite it being world-famous for accepting people of all castes, creeds, colours, cultures, or any confinement of categorisation that your mind could possibly conjure up. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    In my own country, I was mildly fair-skinned, so I never felt marginalised. As a reason, I never had the mental construct of discrimination by colour built into my mindset. I was that simple. I never experienced it for myself, so I never acknowledged it. Make whatever you want of it, it just never occurred to me, the extent to which the pigmentation of one's skin affected their life, and how persistently, it was the primary driving force behind other entities' treatment of them. It also didn't help that my accent sounded funny to the natives, regardless of their own skin pigmentation – that's a whole other issue that was a key motivator that led me to spend most of my time alone, by myself. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I, really, after 4 years of indoctrination, and adaptation, could not find it within myself to speak in the way I wanted. I had always moulded myself, my persona, my language, and my dialect according to what the other person across from me would find comfortable, so this experience wasn't anything particularly novel. I always wanted others to be comfortable with me, because I wanted to be comfortable with them. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I told you that I picked up a mixed dialect as a result of being educated in a multi-cultural environment of my Catholic boarding school, with people from all over the country, as a result of which, my language couldn't really be traced back to anywhere specific in the country, but the country itself. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    That was a problem to me in high-school where I was perceived as an outsider, and that proved to be a problem in college where I literally was an outsider. I grew, I adapted, I tried to switch accents when talking to different sets of people – because of which, I expanded, but at the same time, I lost a little essence of who I really was, because I never really knew much about myself anyway. How could I? I was in my late-teens, early-twenties. Does anyone really expect you to know anything about yourself at that point? </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    How do we then just commit to life-altering decisions at such a young age? We vote for the future our country, we go fight in wars about whose true nature, we don't learn about until decades later – we move entire continents, and leave everything behind that nurtured us, and built all parts of us until that given point in spacetime. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    We do all this in the name of Freedom, and exploration – we love to use the phrases along the lines of "find myself" as if the self is something that was long lost, and that an archaeologic treasure hunt halfway across the globe is needed to truly find <em>our self</em> that has been within us all this time. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    What is freedom really? Why do we need so much freedom? Why don't we accept the world as it was handed to us? Is it really, always that bad? Was it really all that bad when we didn't know anything about it anyway? </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    Everybody's house has problems. That's the nature of living in a confined space and agreeing to raise more of one's kind in said space. We aren't perfect. We have baggage. Is it so unnatural to assume that the person that we get bound to for the rest of our lives will not have an equivalent, if not more, of the same? If those people do not sort their all their problems, before they bring more of their combinations into the world, it is only natural that the new combination that has just arrived on the scene with zero memories, but some innate intuition, will have newer, and also equivalent, if not more, problems of its own – depending on its eternal internal intuition, and it's compatibility and familiarity with said problems. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    If this is the case, which it absolutely is, then how is this model of society sustainable? The world is not running on pure chance, because otherwise, we are all astronomically lucky. If God is not modulating this system, then I'd rather just check out of life the moment I'm born every single time – because I'd like to have at least some notion of control, rather than leave it to random chance. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    That's where I was at that point in spacetime – for most of my college life, I was clinically depressed, and hopelessly suicidal. Every single night, as every single day, was to me, the same. I'd start the day mildly hopeful, every other day I'd make a plan to revive my life's trajectory towards positivity, and every single night I'd disappoint myself. 
                </p>
                    <p class="verse">
                        To avoid feeling constantly like a disappointment, to my own self, and to others that I held dear – I stopped feeling any negative emotions altogether, and saturated myself with physical relievers. I never wanted to feel bad, so I did the opposite – tried to feel good all the time, because, like I've already said, it started because I wanted to explore more of what the world had to offer, and see if life was really worth living. Then, because I had kept this facade up for longer than needed, I lost the true essence of myself altogether. I was it, and it was me. It was how others that saw me defined me. This, and more, I have already discussed ad nauseam in the previous chapter – I was embarrassed because I knew that I had not earned the comfort that I was so wilfully enjoying. If I hadn't been stopped at that point by God, I would've been lost beyond reproach. Well, at the very least, my life would've been geometrically harder. I was afraid because I knew that God came to me, and I was at my lowest point – nakedly indulging, without just cause – and I trembled in fear of what was to follow. 
                    </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    I do not know when exactly I lost faith in God as a concept – I remember for sure, that I never believed in God as an anthropomorphic being – that's one thing I'm eternally grateful for, for having been born in a home where Sikhism was the faith in practice. Like I said, an omnipresent, all powerful entity surely couldn't take the fragile human form – it was just the most stupid notion that never remotely made sense. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    Anyhow, God, as a trusted guide too, had ceased to exist for me – perhaps when I realised that nothing I ever truly wished for in prayers ever came true. I never prayed in a superstitious manner anyway, so it couldn't be that. I had always referred to Him internally as "Babaji," because that's what my mother called Him. </p>
                <p class="verse">

                    I never truly understood why she used that specific term – perhaps because she cannot imagine God not being an anthropomorphic figure – she was exposed more to Hindu mythology, so that might be my best guess as to why. It was very clear that my mom revered God, whatever his form, or lack thereof, may be. That was nurtured in me, even though I had not accepted it for a very long time. 
                </p>

                <p class="verse">
                    Here I was, in my fancy shoe-box of an apartment, in the most talked about place on Earth – unhappy to the deepest recessions of my conscious, and arguably, subconscious being. I had not graduated on time, and I had no further job prospects, and the classes I was still in, just felt pointlessly tiresome. For the past four years, I had felt that way – as if an impending catastrophe was going to befall me. I was not one to pretend that I did not have any problems. I had many. More than I could recount at any given point in time. I had sought help, and the system had truly failed to work for me; as it had failed for countless others in a position similar to mine. 
                </p>

                <p class="verse">
                    Now you might be inclined to say, to each their own, and as a regular human being, I could try to convince you of how, when my whole world came crashing down, I was left with no other options – but that's a very lengthy discussion, given how much I have psychoanalysed my own self, and given how much I have observed the world, the societies, the cultures, the traditions, and the people of my time. Couple those two things with the fact that I know what is actually up with the world due to this divine ordination that I so generously received in my Freedom Bootcamp. Having all this matter up for discussion with a person who is not even remotely as equipped to handle the truth bombs that I was bound to drop on them, would be inhumane. Also, the entirety of that discussion, would be all of Alethia – which, you are very close to completing anyway – so I'll just talk about that stuff I could never talk about to a real person, in a face to face conversation; because, first, they will never be interested in my life to the depths that I am interested in mine. Second, and this is a big one – even if I managed to do all that in a conversational setting, the person would then ask – "if you know everything about everything, then why haven't you fixed it?"

                    Now that's the real kicker, isn't it? All of this realization, and nothing to show for it? What was the whole point of having that discussion if all it was going to acheive was, to make the other person, and myself – feel inadequate? Keep the word inadequate in mind, because that will come in handy in a short while.

                    I say the system, because I sent multiple emails like this, and had multiple conversations like this, and they all said the same thing – seek help. Arguably, it didn't take a genius to figure out that I needed help – I used the actual words that "I need help." I asked friends – they were the same age as me, so of course they were clueless. How could they know more? They were also limited in their exposure to the right information. I asked family – they were the root cause of most of my problems, and me, being their first-born, they had no clue as to how to deal with someone my age. They too, were limited in their exposure, and experience. </p>

                Here's the thing though – in such a beaurocratic system, not everyone has the time, or the empathy to engage in such a lengthy discussion. Arguably, not every person in the position that I was, is able to coherently conjure up actual words to describe these motions. The point that I'm really trying to make here – is that we are all just, almost always, inadequate. We have to work to perfect ourselves to become our best selves. A 22 year old cannot be the best version of a human – that's a recipe for disaster. You peak too soon, so you spend the rest of your life looking back at the supposed "best" times of your life. The best, should always be what's to come – not what's already gone; because what kind of an existence would that be? Isn't the system of wiping your memories at each birth, but keeping your intuition, fair? 

            </p>
            <p class="verse">
                How are we then set up for failure? How could one possibly fathom this system to be unfair, if it really just wants what's best for us. How is it not generous, compassionate, and innately forgiving? I know how one can fathom – because I was just pondering over it today. I was thinking about why the collective consistently arrives at a place where the decadence of the individual causes a catastrophic collapse of the entire system. If it is so easy, almost natural to act like there are no rules in the Game of Life, and that you can get away with anything as long as nobody living being knows about it, how has the world functioned well enough such that we have managed to persist thus far?

                    The point is, there comes a situation, a state of mind, where talking
                    doesn’t help, where you have to look inwards, and sort out the situation
                    from<em> within your own head and assess with clarity the variables that have
                        been clouding your perception</em>. It’s the kind of self-reliance that can’t be taught, or acquired with
                    human inventions and contraptions.

                <p class="verse">
                    Gautam, actually, has spoken at length about this self-reliance. The
                    perceived meaning of Gautam’s philosophy, in today’s times, is a different
                    matter altogether from what He originally preached.

                    Commonplace Buddhist philosophy might have taught you a little something
                    called – <em>detachment</em>. It’s referred to as the feeling of letting go
                    of all intangible meaning that you, yourself have attributed to material
                    objects and perceptual information. Often also called the path of least
                    resistance – of trancing through life as a detached being.

                    I believe you don’t truly learn the value of life, especially as an
                    intelligent being, unless you have

                    what Gautam meant by detachment. That’s what He meant by taking the middle
                    path, the path of never attributing to the extreme meaning of anything –
                    allowing your complete understanding of a situation after careful
                    consideration to take precedence over the <em>assumed</em> meaning of
                    anything. From the Tao Te Ching, I’d like to paraphrase: “One cannot
