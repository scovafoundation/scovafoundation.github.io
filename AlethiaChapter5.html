                    Understand that, there come a lot of points in a human’s life where the
                    person is forced to turn to no one – but their own self. At such a point,
                    vocational exercises with fellow humans do not make sense – because if they
                    had, this person wouldn’t have had been in such a hopeless, such a helpless
                    position.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    The point is, there comes a situation, a state of mind, where talking
                    doesn’t help, where you have to look inwards, and sort out the situation
                    from
                    <em>
                        within your own head and assess with clarity the variables that have
                        been clouding your perception
                    </em>
                    . It’s the kind of self-reliance that can’t be taught, or acquired with
                    human inventions and contraptions.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Gautam, actually, has spoken at length about this self-reliance. The
                    perceived meaning of Gautam’s philosophy, in today’s times, is a different
                    matter altogether from what He originally preached.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Commonplace Buddhist philosophy might have taught you a little something
                    called – <em>detachment</em>. It’s referred to as the feeling of letting go
                    of all intangible meaning that you, yourself have attributed to material
                    objects and perceptual information. Often also called the path of least
                    resistance – of trancing through life as a detached being.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                This might mean to some people as an indication to	<em>not feel anything at all</em>, and let nothing bother you as you face
                    life’s greatest difficulties. It really is just the opposite in actuality –
                    I believe you don’t truly learn the value of life, especially as an
                    intelligent being, unless you have
                    <em>
                        found a way to live, to survive, when all of your rational mental
                        faculties have already given up on you – while
                    </em>
                    striving to find your own self, and being that person in the face of all
                    the chaotic change that bugs you from within like an asphyxiating
                    dissonance.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Truth be told, as you grow up, you have to <strong>unlearn</strong> most
                    things that you learnt as a kid, and <em>label them correctly</em>. That is
                    what Gautam meant by detachment. That’s what He meant by taking the middle
                    path, the path of never attributing to the extreme meaning of anything –
                    allowing your complete understanding of a situation after careful
                    consideration to take precedence over the <em>assumed</em> meaning of
                    anything. From the Tao Te Ching, I’d like to paraphrase: “One cannot
                    understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite.”

                    Our journeys in existence are predicated by societal constructs. Sure, the
                    level of sentience that we successively gain determines our ability to
                affect our surroundings by sheer <em>thought and action</em>, but until we	<em>level up</em> in that regard, we are stuck playing the social game.

                    On the subject of wandering in search of meaning (or lack thereof), I would
                    like to digress onto this question – why is it always assumed that events
                    in our life can only be one of two things: either mightily meaningful – as
                    if the whole world revolves around us, or just pure randomness, as if we
                    are all just molecules walking around procuring, excreting and conspiring
                    with other molecules?

                    much of it is dependent on your imagination? What are you hoping to get out
                    of this moment – if anything? How does the occurrence of this moment affect
                    you? What about others around you? How does the exact same scenario change
                    by changing some variables? And if this moment can be recreated – are the
                    feelings that you get in different versions of this moment even real? Do
                    you get the same feelings every time? How much do these feelings change? If

                    how much the person is temporally caught up to the mental best version of

                    life to live, and if you are truly enjoying that good life without harming
                    innocent people, better yet, benefitting innocent people with your acts of
                    altruism – then it is really okay.

                    witnessed the wonders of God’s generosity because you were never educated
                    in His ways, so you don’t realize the impact He has been having on your

                    It is a whole other debacle when you are a religious person with a bad
                    habit. You already know that God is everywhere, so even if you conceal this
                    habit from the rest of the world, you are naked in front of God. You
                    already know that your actions will have consequences; especially the
                    negative actions – which will bring negativity into your own life. Each
                    time you commit to doing a negative thing, a knot forms in your body
                    (literally) and your soul gets tainted with a dark blur.

                    more pronounced. When you are outwardly religious, you are an example to
                    the world on how God keeps those that love and worship His system. If you
                    are then engaged in a negative action, it harms you more than it would harm

                    All that you consume, all that you take in, all that goes inside your body
                    – is a sort of a drug. The air that you breathe, the light that you absorb,
                    the food you intake, the flowers you smell – in their true essence, they’re
                    all drugs. Doing drugs is not a problem. Taking drugs is not a problem.
                    Sure. You cannot survive normally without oxygen, or water. That’s alright.
                    God has meant for it to be that way. God, has also created tobacco. He has
                    also created marijuana. He has given you grapes to ferment wine. The
                    printing press was invented because of a wine enthusiast monk. Most of the
                    great works of human art were done under the influence of some sort of
                    drug. Music is a drug. Fruits are drugs. Bread is a drug. When your body
                    starts to feel like something is lacking in <em>life</em> without them,

                    first part around their over consumption, and the next around their over
                    aversion. Neither works. Sometimes you want drugs, sometimes you need them.
                    Sex is a drug. Pleasure itself is a drug. In their true form, they are all
                    just molecular interactions with internal bodily chemistry that gives you a
                    sensation of being <em>more </em>alive. I say more, because the humdrum

                        Gaining access to the Holy Spirit is pretty fucking neat if it allows
                        for the things that it does.

                        proximity to you.

                    will one day. Just not now. All of my human life will just be a preparation

                    back would be rock solid; but I’m not just any person, am I? I am bound to
                    do all the great things that took these super-humans entire lifetimes, and

                    You would think that that society values people who can hold their liquor,
                    or people who can manage to act normal on drugs are cool. That’s simply not
                    the case. Those people have made their heightened sense of awareness their
                    “normal.” They simply will never be at a point where they can be their
                    best, their true self without drugs. Not without a prolonged period of
                    abstinence. Hence Lent. The period of penance, or simply, abstinence from
                    the substances and experiences that hinder people from enjoying heavenly

                    The story of 40 days of temptation is not just restricted to six weeks
                    alone in the desert. It is a story of isolation in one’s own mind of not
                    being able to stick to God's plan of salvation. Before saving the world,
                    Christ had to save himself.

                    The chains of temptations hinder the Holy Spirit from entering a person’s
                    body and cleansing the soul, and nourishing the tree of life. The body,
                    mind, soul and the surroundings are not cleansed, and thus, hindered from
                    evolving into something beautiful - from living a life in which not only
                    goals are accomplished, but in which expectations are exceeded. It only
                    leaves the person being capable enough to accomplish tasks, but not rising
                    up to the level of achieving legendary status. It’s not just about
                    accomplishing, but achieving.

                    that I will have completed before finishing this book. I have to be ready,

                    self-loathing, beyond self-hatred. I could kill myself, but things wouldn’t
                    be as easy the next time. All this work, all of this life - all of my

                    tale had to begin somewhere, it would definitely be at the point that I had
                    decided to stop being human. I couldn’t be prone to any fault, however tiny

                    time. Everything else can be taught and explained and understood. This has
                    to be lived and suffered through, alone. You pick up this habit against the

                    on following his guidelines for only so long. Time will catch up with you
                    soon enough, so better be ready to quit and build up your life, or hold
                    onto this negative habit and keep living the shit life that you have been

                    The only thing I never quit was quitting itself.

                    It was the same story every time – binge on the last couple doses of my
                    favourite drug, or maybe flush it all down the toilet – whatever method my
                    mind fancied in the spur of the moment. The moment God hinted to me that
                    something big was going to be announced on the news, I panicked like all
                    the lost humans on this planet did – panic bought the things that they
                    would for sure need during a prolonged emergency. For some it was
                    groceries, for others it was alcohol, for many it was drugs – and you know
                    which category I fell into.

                    I realised that if God had signalled to me beforehand on the magnitude of
                    the situation, it must be that this was truly the prelude, of the Beginning
                    of the End. Days later, my country’s Prime Minister announced a lockdown of
                    the entire nation for a single day. I, with many other discerning folks,
                    knew this to be a test for something bigger. Sure enough, it was later
                    announced that this would turn into a 21 Day curfew.

                    It was in that moment, that I had an epiphany (as I always did moments
                    before I began to quit my addiction) – if all it takes is 21 days to form a
                    new habit, then surely enough, it would also take 21 days to overwrite an
                    existing habit.

                    Thus began the experiment – while everybody on my social lists was busy

                    is April 13, 2020 CE and I believe it has been over 21 days since I
                    initially began to quit, for the last time.

                    I did falter, <strong>once</strong>, during all this time, which, I
                    would’ve done a lot of, had it not been for such a strict curfew. This last
                    infraction of mine was quite possibly, the lowest I have stooped to get to
                    this thing. Surely enough, after this infraction, the lockdown got further
                    extended. Now, you might again come to think of this as an ego-maniacal

                    victims, cultures, and borders. To base this whole pandemonium around my

                    my time, and if I was going to shoulder their pain, live through their

                    panic surrounding it. Nations closed their borders, people were confined to
                    their own homes, businesses shut down and markets closed. In my own
                    country, a strict lockdown was imposed that lasted until May 3rd, 2020.
                    This period is exactly 70 weeks. The extent of the lockdown itself? 7
