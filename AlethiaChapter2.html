                <p class="verse">
                    In most social situations, especially where drugs and alcohol is involved,
                    most people judge your personality by the <em>vibe</em> you give them in
                    the moment with a thought that goes along the lines of — “Can I kick back,
                    relax, and have a beer with this person?” If yes, you’re in. You are the
                    considered a part of the imaginary group of people that this person would
                    choose to hangout with, if such an opportunity ever arose.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Even if the social situation has no indication of such a future connection,
                    most people are thinking about it — consciously, or subconsciously. Even if
                the social setting is such that no possible future connection can be made,	<em>most people just need an excuse to talk</em>.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    Not that talking without purpose is in any way wrong. On the contrary, it
                    is talking without an end-goal or predisposition that often leads to
                    serendipitous understanding – of the situations that you are, and have been
                    in, and about the other person, and by extension, the self.
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    And this precept is quite valid if your religion-centric mind can get
                    beyond the fact that I just said doing drugs and drinking alcohol –
                    socially – is <em>acceptable</em> (it is still <em>very</em> wrong, but
                    you’ll see why shortly). Mind you, the word I have used is “acceptable.”
                    Like all italicised words in the book, pay special attention.

                    <em>“Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; </br>
                        but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.” </br>

                    If you really have to indulge in such a thing, do it out in the open – with
                    other people around you – so they can see who you truly are when your
                    prefrontal cortex has given up a certain amount of control, given the
                    amount of illicit substance currently in your body.

                <p class="verse">
                    It is true, that when you relax your senses, your inhibitions, and by
                    extension, your best judgement – you are losing some control to what is, in
                    appearance, separate from the self. You open yourself up in front of this separated entity – make yourself	<em>vulnerable</em>, and thus, open to exploitation. In such a situation,
                    the elements of said entity can make <em>you say</em> things you wouldn’t
                    have otherwise, they can make <em>you confess</em> to personal stuff since
                    you are more prone to sharing details that you wouldn’t have otherwise.
                    They can make <em>you engage </em>in activities that you wouldn’t have
                    otherwise. Life doesn’t get much beyond stupid high-school games.

                    All of us are just expected to do adult things because we have spent so
                    much time LOL-ing around. We are expected to do better, more mature things
                    based on the stuff we have learnt in all our traversal in this spacetime
                    and in this life. Sometimes the actual experience doesn’t really matter, it is just a matter
                    of having spent more time in a situation than the other person that leads
                    most people to think you have more <strong>experience</strong>.

                <p class="verse">
                    This is most often true in social situations. A large chuck of all social interation, is really just predicated around an experienced entity being engaged by others with seemingly lesser experience. Most of your knowledge <em>about</em>
                    social situations comes from your family, and this is subconsciously
                    engrained in you, since you have been watching your family in social
                    situations since before you knew the difference between private and public
                    behaviour.

                    a part of your natural mannerisms. Sometimes you work hard to get rid of
                    these behaviours, sometimes you flaunt them knowingly. Your relationship
                    with these mannerisms mostly depends upon your relationship with your

                    apparently being maniacal – they don’t trust me being alone. Even more so,

                    My parents did however, in that instance, let me go since I hadn’t seen the outside world,
                    without a family member’s presence, for over a year now. I wasn’t at home
                all this time by force; it was <em>by choice</em>.	<strong>I was still in shock.</strong> I had come home from New York City,
                    which was, at the time, arguably one of the most highly recommended spaces
                    in the world to be social (or anti-social). I had come home thinking I would only be there for six months and then I
                    would move onto the next location of my Journey, wherever that might be,
                    doing whatever it is that God thought suitable for me. Apparently God
                    sought Ludhiana to be suitable for the next part of my Journey, and willed
                    that it be the place where I rightfully set my roots.

                <p class="verse">
                    Of course, I was born in Ludhiana, and this is where my parents had been
                    since they got married; but I was never really here. My thoughts, my
                    dreams, my hopes, my aspirations, and my desires were elsewhere. I had
                    never truly accepted Ludhiana as my home, and in turn, Ludhiana had never
                    truly accepted me. It made sense then, that wherever I went in this city,
                    and whoever I talked to, thought of me as an outsider.

                <p class="verse">
                    To add to the outsider complex, I was also not a social kid when I was
                    young – I made one friend in kinder garden and then stuck to that person
                    until I left that school. I don’t really remember much from that time,
                    other than the fact that I was a socially awkward, wallflower type kid who
                    cried a lot because most things were too hurtful. I looked back last night, at some of my pictures from that time. They were all taken at some competition, or at some social event – looking at them, you surely wouldn't not be able to verify my description of that time – because who take a picture of their kid when they come home from school, having crapper their shorts? It is of empirical importance, that kids have a happy childhood, or at the very least, the appearance of it.

                    I have seen the same traits in my sister over the years, so from this

                    the <em>familial environment (some of it nature, most of it nurture)</em>.
                    This, I remember, because these mannerisms had followed me to my boarding
                    school in Mussoorie. I was, at the time, a cranky kid, in a boys’ school –
                    imagine how I would be treated.

                    My parents and I have taken a lot of decisions together since then, but I

                    to my likings whenever I asked them for something – this particular
                    decision was one that would shape the rest of my path. For the first time,
                    I was outside Ludhiana on my own. I didn’t know it yet, but in St George’s
                    College, I would be known and associated with the <em>space</em> I had
                    never myself associated with, all my life.

                    class was the biggest social group a kid could hope to be a part of. So,
                    for the first time – my also mind wandered towards defining myself in terms
                    of my religion, the only group that I could be a part of and yet stay my
                    unique self. I had for the first time, heard myself being called by my full

                    I remember the first time we, as a family, went out of the country – to our supposed "enemy" country of Pakistan. We went there for a couple days to watch a single cricket match that spanned a couple days. I want to call it a test-match, but I'm not sure cricket will remain relevant for posterity. Maybe it will, so I will not be talking about why an actual competitive game is called a "test" match. My family (apart from my father) were not particularly interested in cricket, but we went along anyway, because travel was convenient (we literally crossed the border on foot), and the tickets for the match didn't cost all that much (can't say the same for our accommodation). Really though, we went because we weren't aware of the instability that was the norm within the country at the time. This was before the internet had saturated our lives.

                <p class="verse">
                    Outside the stadium, where our cab driver dropped us off, there was a group of young guys, doing <em>bhangra</em> with the traditional <em>dhol</em>. They were <em>Punjabi</em>, just like us, so this was a welcome sight. They called out to my father with the calls of <em>"oho sardarji, aao ji,"</em> signalling to my turbaned father, to come and join them in the dance. My father, who appeared to me an ignorant simpleton at the time, wilfully complied. After the deed was done, and we were making our way to the stadium again, all of us realized at nearly the same moment, that they were actually making fun of my father, and told him to not partake in such tomfoolery again – to which my father replied that he didn't really have a choice. He didn't want to turn the group into an angry mob, so he plastered a smile, and indulged them. 
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    A couple of obvious things stand out to me now, when this incident has been brought to my attention at this particular junction in the chapter. The first being that my father was only called at, because of his perceived difference. Had he not been wearing a turban, the crowd would not have realised that we were different from them, and hence, would not have had any reason to bother a family to partake in their diversion. The second being that he was called at, with full knowledge that he was essentially the same as them, as our religion was associated with the province of Punjab, and hence, the dance of bhangra was native to us. The third being, that he was called out with kind salutations of "ji," which is used when you are referring to someone respectfully. Fourth, the use of the term "sardar," which, initially adopted for its revered stature, was now often used in a derogatory context, alluding to the supposed stereotype of a stupid-sardar, who couldn't understand the nuances of a situation, and was often looked at as a simpleton. 
                </p>
                <p class="verse">
                    It is weird, that this idea of the simpleton sardar originated towards the end of Mughal India, almost definitely during the period of annexation of Delhi, by the Iranian Muslim ruler, Nader Shah. The story goes, that around the year 1739 CE, the Shah's men were not only looting treasures during their conquests, but also taking Hindu women hostage. Sardar Jassa Singh, commander of the Sikh army at that time, decided to attack Nader Shah’s troops at midnight. It began a series of extractions, where the Sikh army would attack Muslim raiders at midnight, and bring back the women to their homes. That whole series of occurrences began a smear campaign, probably starting of as a deprecating joke arising out of insecurity and contempt, about sardars going mad at midnight. To this day, turbaned sikhs, all over the world have to be the butt of those jokes about being stupid, especially more so, when the clock is about to strike 12.

                    I mention this, not to gain sympathy, certainly not to reignite religious tensions – 11 year old me was mightily affected by the riots that broke out in the city on the day we were scheduled to leave Pakistan, than by this minor brush with discrimination. Markets were closed, not a single uninvolved bystander was to be seen, every turn we took just led to a wall of lynching crowd – cracking windows, and burning tyres. My father had to remove his turban, and my sisters were hidden from outside view. God knows what their issue was at the time, but years later when I recounted this issue to a Pakistani friend of mine, he scoffed "unka roz ka hai, aap hamare ghar aaye, khatirdaari karenge" – <em>this is usual for them, you should come to our house sometime, you'll be well taken care of.</em> I'm assuming he meant people of Lahore in general, but he could very well be talking about a particular faction. I can't remember, we were sufficiently baked. The trip to Pakistan too, would've been erased from memory, had it not been for these two occurrences. We had a pre-planned vacation to Malaysia and Singapore just a day later, so that overwrote a bunch of trauma. To be quite honest, our family was doing very well in life, all things considered. </p>
                    
                    <p class="verse"> 
                    I really don't care for sympathy by mentioning this interaction with the dancing group of ignorant simpletons, which is probably the reason why I mentioned that we were well-off. Perhaps I wanted to incite a certain amount of dissonance in you? Maybe. Really though, I wanted to point out the intricate irrationality that is reflected in each of our ignorant actions, especially more so in the case of discrimination, positive or negative. Think about all the different ways in which we have to alter the flow of our regular routines to accommodate others who aren't aware of the implications of their own actions. I'm absolutely sure, that there isn't a single person on this planet, who has not faced discrimination – it is the baggage that we inherited, but were not born with. It is time to let that go. We are all the same here. Why don't we treat each other well? What's the point of enemity when all known territory has been conquered, and is under some administration? Why is it still about us and them, and not just us?

                    about a general experience in a social setting where drugs and alcohol is
                    involved, yet somehow God makes Me write this chapter in a way that it
                    becomes highly personal to Me, and Me alone, while relating to a million

                    Back to Mussoorie – I was in a different place, a long way from home –
                    deeply entrenched in the mountains. We had little contact with the outside
                    world, and whatever “outings” we had, lasted mere hours in this small

                    For the most part, the people you went to school with, became your dorm
                    mates, and since we all slept in the same dorm, we were at times, closer
                    than family. I say this, because family affects you in deep and profound
                    ways, and since I had found myself in a different family, my mannerisms
                    would now adapt to be more associated with my current peers. Perhaps I had to work a little harder to adapt with my speech and personality, because I was always perceived as visually different from what I was supposed to look like – folks in Punjab always called me Nepalese, most strangers in New York thought of me as Mexican, and to those in my boarding school, I was many things, but the major part of my description of them, was Sardar. Really though, whatever they perceived me as, <em>it was almost never an association of being a different variation of their own self, but a familiar variation of the other</em>.

                    Since these new peers were from all over the country, talking to, and

                    not be placed to a single location. I picked up different things from
                    different people – as a result, I learnt to be comfortable with all kinds
                    of people. It is really something when you’re a turbaned Indian Sikh kid in
                    a Catholic school of British Colonial era. It was the kind of multicultural

                    the cue has been heard. I say that the reply doesn’t need to be relevant because most of the times,
                    other people in the group aren’t in a position to give the correct answer,
                    and they might never be in that particular situation to know what needs to
                    be known for a person in that position. You could say it is equivalent to
                    talking to a wall, but I would vehemently disagree.

                        A wall does not have consciousness, and neither can your voiced

                    observed by the populace, lending to the colloquial expression “go with the

                    As it turns out, even the Cartesian point of view of the mind-matter

                    So, when it is said that alcohol and other drugs get the participating

                    that the participating members get on the same <em>vibrating frequency</em>
                    as each other – something that would’ve taken arduous bonding time without

                    easily than they would have otherwise. So when I say that in opening up in

                    this moment perfectly align with the picture you had in mind? Are there any
                    extraneous elements that could possibly ruin this moment? When does this
                    moment begin? Does it have to end? Are other people involved in this
                    moment? Or is it a solo thing? If you are alone in this moment, then, how
                    much of it is dependent on your imagination? What are you hoping to get out
                    of this moment – if anything? How does the occurrence of this moment affect
                    you? What about others around you? How does the exact same scenario change
                    by changing these variables? And if this moment can be recreated at a later
                    time, in a different space – are the feelings that you get in different
                    versions of this moment even real? Do you get the same feelings every time?
                    How much do these feelings change? If the feelings have changed, is the
                    moment still the same? (see: Ship of Theseus)

                    True emotion only occurs when our train of thought is the opposite of the
                    aforementioned paragraph. It requires a level of self-satisfaction that
                    most of us are almost-never in a position of attaining. Of course, being
                    with the right people helps our cause, and yes, drugs and alcohol do help
                in <em>briefly experiencing</em> such a state –	<strong>but only up until a specific threshold</strong>. After that, so
                    much control is lost <em>from the self</em> onto the separated entity, that
                    it almost immediately results in self-humiliation and validation of
                    insecurities.

                    We engage in activities that our sober-self would immediately find contrary
                    to our lifestyle and beliefs. We end up committing what in the
                    pre-enlightened times would be called <em>cardinal sins</em>. Life is
                    already hard enough for most people without involving the stupidity of
                    alcohol and drugs into the equation.

                    This is the prime reason why they are vehemently discouraged by most
                    religions – human beings are stupid enough even without illicit substances
                    in their system, nobody wants the complications of their after effects. It
                    is a very tricky balance that only a handful few are well equipped to keep
                    up with. <em>I wasn’t – for a very long time</em>.

                The ongoing quest of my entire life	<em>until any given point in spacetime</em> has always been to find mundane
                    reasons to explain the supernatural, and as is the nature of Alethia – I
                    always end up using the supernatural to explain the mundane. And as I have
                    stated quite obtusely just a couple paragraphs ago,

                        moments of true emotion do not last very long to work well in your

                        lost – quite quickly I might add

                    So when I say that a person needs to be vulnerable to experience true
                    emotion, for the force of life to freely flow, I am asking a lot of that
                    person. On one hand they are required to not overthink, on the other hand
                    if they don’t at least think things through, life can go downhill pretty
                    quickly. Why shouldn’t people exploit your inebriated gaffes when you
                    would’ve cherished doing the same?

                    My advice is, exercise the best judgement you have left, and decide the
                    extent of stupidity you are going to indulge in. If you do not trust this
                    entity, behave according to the prevalent protocol of your time and space.
                    For shorthand – for most things, and most strangers in social situations,
                    always <em>assume</em>:

                    If you have to engage in small talk about the weather and sports, do it. If
                    you have to take the customary “one hit” to get your foot in, do it. If you
                    have to alter your self-identity to try to “fit-in,” then you are seeking a
                    validation that you will never truly find. Don’t lie to yourself – if you
                    do not get to be your real self in that moment, that is only because of the
